1,"The unreal spectacle of COP26;COP26 has had a prepackaged feel to it, and more than a whiff of self-indulgence","November 12, 2021 Friday",Non-jurisdictional,Breaking News from globeandmail.com,News,825,,825,,Konrad Yakabuski,,REGIE NATIONALE DES USINES RENAULT SA,REGIE NATIONALE DES USINES RENAULT SAGRAHAM HOLDINGS CO,"The unreal spectacle of COP26COP26 has had a prepackaged feel to it, and more than a whiff of self-indulgence","LeadAs the United Nations COP26 climate conference hurtled toward its climax this week, it was hard not to get the impression that the 40,000 official participants gathered in Glasgow for what many billed as the last chance to save the planet were playing a game of virtual reality.Over the course of two weeks, the world bore witness to a flurry of declarations followed by prolonged sessions of mutual backslapping among the signatories, and admonishments from climate activists about the utter inadequacy of said commitments.Texte/TextIn Glasgow, more than 40 countries, including Canada, agreed to ""accelerate a transition away from unabated coal power generation."" But China, the United States and India - which together account for about 70 per cent of the coal burned to generate electricity - were conspicuously absent from the deal. As was Australia, whose economy depends more than most on coal exports.Another non-binding agreement involving 130 countries - Canada included - committed signatories to ending deforestation by 2030. The emptiness of the undertaking was apparent as Indonesian officials specified that it would be ""obviously inappropriate and unfair"" to adhere to the pledge at the expense of economic development.Another caveat-filled agreement to which Canada signed on involved a pledge to ""work toward all sales of new cars and vans being zero emission globally by 2040, and by no later than 2035 in leading markets."" But four of the world's largest automakers - Volkswagen, Toyota, Renault-Nissan and Hyundai-Kia - were not among the signatories. Neither was China.Speaking of which, Chinese President Xi Jinping skipped the Glasgow gabfest altogether rather than face a public scolding about his country's ""dangerous lack of urgency,"" as former U.S. president Barack Obama described it. Mr. Xi refused to be lectured to by leaders from the developed countries that have a century-long emissions head start over China - now the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases.John Kerry, U.S. President Joe Biden's climate envoy, nevertheless handed Mr. Xi a propaganda victory with a joint declaration in which the United States and China agreed to co-operate on climate-related efforts. But the agreement - which according to The Washington Post, was ""the product of nearly three dozen negotiating sessions"" between U.S. and Chinese diplomats over the course of the past year - was thin gruel even by UN standards.By week's end, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, seeking to bask in the glow of the Glasgow summit to distract from the domestic political scandal now engulfing his government, was nudging the parties toward a face-saving final agreement that would preserve the notion that COP26 had been worth its weight in CO2 emissions despite appearances to the contrary.The whole event had a prepackaged feel to it, and more than a whiff of self-indulgence among the participants who live for such gatherings and the networking opportunity they represent.It was as if, inside the Glasgow bubble, no one had even heard of geopolitics or technology, even though they remain the biggest obstacles to tackling climate change. In reality, the energy transition is akin to a high-stakes game of chess that threatens to reconfigure power structures across the globe.Even countries dependent on imported fossil fuels that theoretically stand to benefit from the phasing out of oil, natural gas and coal are unwilling to risk the political and economic upheaval that such a transition would entail. China, a net importer of oil and coal that dominates the global market for batteries and solar panels, might conceivably stand to come out on the winning end of an energy transition. But Mr. Xi understands better than anyone that his country is nowhere near being able to end its dependence on fossil fuels and that, in the absence of the technological breakthroughs that remain elusive, may never be.The same goes for India, where the millions of future climate refugees who risk being displaced by severe weather events are vastly outnumbered by the hundreds of millions of people for whom access to fossil fuels remains a ticket to a more comfortable life.It is no secret why Russian President Vladimir Putin was also a no-show in Glasgow. He has been too busy in recent weeks turning the screws on Europe, whose leaders have been grovelling for him to send them more Russian natural gas as they brace for a winter of discontent among voters facing skyrocketing energy bills. Besides, any effort to accelerate a ""phase out"" of fossil fuels would threaten to bankrupt the Russian state and sow political chaos.Ditto for Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Mexico, Algeria, Nigeria and a slew of other dictatorships or struggling democracies for which fossil fuels are the primary, if not sole, source of wealth.

He was here on Wednesday, I welcomed that. In his shoes, I may have stayed here for the remainder of the summit, but come back. Every shoulder to the wheel.READ MORE: COP26: ‘Monumental challenge’ remains to reach agreement – Alok Sharma“I’m not in the negotiating room. That can feel frustrating sometimes. But get there, and make sure that no stone is left unturned in getting this agreement to where it needs to be.”She said Boris Johnson should return to COP26 to push people on to a path “where we avoid climate catastrophe.”When asked what her message to the Prime Minister would be, she said: “My message to the Prime Minister is come back here.""Use your position as president of this COP to really drive progress and push people as far as we can get them.“Because every inch forward that this text takes is of course another inch towards getting the world on to a path where we avoid climate catastrophe, and nothing, literally nothing, is more important than that.”She added: “The reason I’m singling out Boris Johnson is not just because we’re in the UK – well, it is actually because we’re in the UK, because the UK is the COP presidency, and that puts a particular onus on the shoulders of the UK Government.”The First Minister also said she does not want the Cambo oil field to be ""given the green light"", and ""at the very least"" it should undergo ""the most rigorous climate assessment""Asked if Friday would be the last day of COP26, she added: “I wouldn’t bet lots of money on that. I hope we see progress today.“I certainly hope that finishing at six o’clock tonight, which is the plan, would be possible.“Equally, I would not be surprised to know that it was going into tomorrow.”It is hoped that an agreement at COP26 will curb fossil fuel use and limit global temperature rises to 1.5C. A new draft of an agreement was produced on Friday morning and contained strengthened language on getting countries to “revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets” in their national action plans by the end of 2022 to align with global goals to limit temperature rises to “well below” 2C and try to limit them to 1.5C.There is also more on finance for poorer countries to adapt with climate change and a request for all nations to strengthen their plans for cutting emissions up to 2030 by the end of next year.READ MORE: More protests on final day of COP26The first draft of the “cover decision” for the overarching agreement at the summit called for countries “to accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels”.In a new draft produced on Friday morning, that has changed to calling on countries to accelerate the shift to clean energy systems, “including by rapidly scaling up clean power generation and accelerating the phaseout of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels”.The inclusion of a direct reference to coal and fossil fuel subsidies was thought to be a first for a UN decision document of this type but had been expected to get fierce pushback from some countries and may not make it into the final text.Talks went on through the night and look set to overrun from their finish time of Friday evening as negotiators come under pressure to resolve issues around finance for poor countries, fossil fuels, the efforts of countries to cut emissions in the 2020s and rules on carbon markets and transparency.There is debate over the language on getting countries to “revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets” in their national action plans by the end of 2022 to align with the Paris temperature goals.In the Paris Agreement in 2015, countries committed to limit temperature rises to “well below” 2C and try to limit them to 1.5C – beyond which the worst impacts of climate change will be felt.Scientists have warned that keeping temperature rises to 1.5C – beyond which the worst impacts of climate change will be felt – requires global emissions to be cut by 45% by 2030, and to zero overall by mid-century.But current action plans known as nationally determined contributions for emissions cuts up to 2030 leave the world well off track to meet the goal, and could see warming of 2.4C over the long term.Therefore, countries are under pressure to rapidly increase their ambition for emission cuts in the 2020s to stop the 1.5C goal slipping out of reach.The new version of the text “requests” countries to revisit and strengthen their plans for 2030 within the next year, compared to the previous version which “urges” them to do so.Michael Jacobs, former climate adviser to Gordon Brown and veteran of Cop talks, and Peter Betts, former lead UN climate negotiator for the EU, and UK, both suggested the new wording was stronger, but the World Resources Institute (WRI) think tank, said it was a weakening of the language.Cop president Alok Sharma has been clear there are no efforts to renegotiate the Paris Agreement – which means that both the “well below” 2C and 1.5C targets are still both included in the Paris goal – though he has also said a key aim of Glasgow is about keeping the 1.5C goal within reach.In the wake of the new draft, shadow business secretary Ed Miliband warned: “It’s clear that the aim of this summit to keep 1.5 alive is in mortal peril.“There has been some welcome progress on strengthening the pathway out of Glasgow in the new draft.“But there is still too much ambiguity about the responsibility of all countries to align their targets with 1.5C and important language on keeping fossil fuels in the ground has been watered down.He said: “It is absolutely vital that there is no backsliding, no fudges and no bending over backwards for the big emitters over the next crucial hours.”Greenpeace International executive director Jennifer Morgan said of the text: “It could be better, it should be better, and we have one day left to make it a lot, lot better.”Providing finance for developing countries to develop cleanly, adapt to the impacts of climate change and address the loss and damage to people, livelihoods, land and infrastructure already being hit by increasing weather extremes and rising seas is also key to securing a deal in Glasgow.Helen Mountford, WRI vice-president for climate and economics, said: “Overall, on balance this is definitely a stronger and more balanced text than we had a few days ago.”She said sections on adaptation finance and loss and damage appear stronger but the reference to “inefficient” fossil fuel subsidies “does weaken that a little”.She said a gap remains on the pledge from developed nations to mobilise one billion US dollars a year from 2020, with no reference to making up the current shortfall.There is now a date – missing from the first draft – for when developed countries should double the provision of finance to help developing countries adapt to climate change – by 2025.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this article.

From Hollywood stars in Maryhill and Irn Bru tasting sessions, to sleeping world leaders, Cop26 has had its lighter moments.Now, The Herald has ranked the top moments and funny scenes which have brought a light-hearted perspective to\xC2the crucial climate talks.\xC21. President Joe Biden 'flashed by large naked Scottish man' on way to GlasgowPresident Joe Biden may have expected to see sweeping vistas, misty glens and towering, heather-clad peaks on his arrival in\xC2Scotland.\xC2But what he got was something altogether different.\xC2Assembled members of the media, the White House staff and presumably First Lady Jill Biden and the President himself were given a glimpse of a\xC2'a large, naked, Scottish man' who stood in his window taking pictures as they drove past.A member of the press travelling with the White House team is reported to have told British journalists:\xC2\xE2At one point when we were still on smaller country roads, a large, naked \xC2Scottish man stood \xC2in his front window taking a picture of the motorcade with his phone.\xE2From the White House pool report on @POTUS journey from Edinburgh to Glasgow:\xE2At one point when we were still on smaller country roads, a large, naked Scottish man stood in his front window taking a picture of the motorcade with his phone.\xE2Welcome to Scotland, Mr President\xE2 Jon Sopel (@BBCJonSopel) November 2, 2021\xC22.

AOC on the hunt for Irn Bru branding it Kola ChampagneUS congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez gave her verdict on Irn-Bru after getting her hands on some of Scotland's other national\xC2drink.\xC2\xC2The New York Representative\xC2gave the orange soft drink her seal of approval\xC2 - even saying it reminded her of home.\xC2Apparently, Irn-Bru is similar to the taste of\xC2Kola Champagne \xE2 another \xE2soda\xE2 popular in Latin America.She tweeted: \xE2I finally got a hold of some Irn-Bru.\xE2\xC2\xC24.\xC2Sleepy JoeThe US president stole the headlines when he touched down in Scotland on Air Force One. His 20 vehicle long motorcade also caught the attention of Scottish residents, as they made their way from Edinburgh to Glasgow while he was attending the climate summit.\xC2However, the 78-year-old American leader was caught apparently drifting off during the opening COP26 speeches, and the footage tweeted out by a Washington Post journalist went viral.It was pretty bad timing on the presidents behalf, as he appears to fall asleep over a speech which stated: ""This conference is one of the most imprtant meetings in world history.""Biden appears to fall asleep during COP26 opening speeches pic.twitter.com/az8NZTWanI\xE2 Zach Purser Brown (@zachjourno) November 1, 20215. Glasgow ProtestsCertain Glasgow protests brought the city to a standstill and caused major disruption for motorists, but no one can doubt the creativity some activists put into their demonstrations.From Red Rebels to a protester dressed as a 10ft tree called Stumpy, Glasgow was witness to some mind-boggling activist activity.\xC2Activists from Extinction Rebellion were also spotted sat in a rubber dingy in the middle of St Vincent Street while the area was surrounded by officers.Other activity seen activists dress up as world leaders and play children's games whilst others dressed as Squid Game guards watched on, and it also seen a massive inflatable of the Loch Ness monster in the Clyde being confiscated by police.6. Planes in 'valet style' services between Glasgow and Prestwick Airport\xC2As COP26 began last week, we revealed multiple aircraft took 20-minute journeys between Glasgow and Prestwick Airport after dropping off delegates at COP26.Flight data seen by The Herald shows a dozen planes making a trip between Glasgow Airport and Prestwick Airport from October 31\xC2as world leaders landed in\xC2Scotland\xC2for the climate summit in Glasgow.Our analysis shows aircraft\xC2carrying delegates from countries including Cyprus, Egypt, Bolivia and Croatia landing\xC2in Glasgow Airport on Sunday, only to return to the runway mere hours later to make a 25-minute-long trip to the Ayrshire port.\xC27.\xC2US officials try Irn-Bru, Deep fried mars bars and moreAmerica delegates attending Glasgow for COP26 sampled some Scottish cuisine to familiarise themselves with the local culture.They posted a video of their tasting reactions and\xC2questionable pronounciation of Scotland's most famous food and drink selections on Twitter\xC2for everyones\xC2entertainment.The officials all appeared to go into the tasting session with an open mind as they tried a list of items including Irn-Bru, cullen skink, haggis and of course the famous deep-fried mars bar.Before we head to Scotland next week, we thought we'd get together and try some of the local cuisine... #COP26Glasgow pic.twitter.com/RN8t5Zx98J\xE2 Charg\xC3 d'Affaires Philip T.

Use your position as president of this Cop to really drive progress and push people as far as we can get them.\xE2Because every inch forward that this text takes is of course another inch towards getting the world on to a path where we avoid climate catastrophe, and nothing, literally nothing, is more important than that.\xE2She added: \xE2The reason I\xE2m singling out Boris Johnson is not just because we\xE2re in the UK \xE2 well, it is actually because we\xE2re in the UK, because the UK is the Cop presidency, and that puts a particular onus on the shoulders of the UK Government.\xE28:46amGood morning and welcome to The National's COP26 live blog.Here's the latest\xC2A new\xC2draft of the deal that could be agreed at the Glasgow COP26 climate talks appears to have watered down its push to curb fossil fuels. The first draft of the \xE2cover decision\xE2 for the overarching agreement at the summit called for countries \xE2to accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels\xE2. In a new draft produced this morning, that has changed to calling on countries to accelerate the shift to clean energy systems, \xE2including by rapidly scaling up clean power generation and accelerating the phaseout of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels\xE2. Nicola Sturgeon said she has not had a chance to properly absorb the new draft of the deal that could be agreed at Cop26 but that, from what she has seen, she would describe it as \xE2inching forward\xE2, adding that there is time to improve it. She said there has been some \xE2incremental progress\xE2, but added: \xE2If I was a young person looking into this summit right now I would say it\xE2s not good enough."" Nicola Sturgeon has been hailed as the ""true leader"" to emerge from COP26 after she doubled a commitment to help tackle the damages of\xC2climate change.

8,COP26: What is the 1.5 degrees Celcius climate change target? What will happen if the world goes past 1.5 degrees of global warming?,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Scotsman,News,674,ENVIRONMENTENVIRONMENT,674,Scotland,Ginny Sandersonginny.sanderson@jpimedia.co.uk,,NETFLIX INC,NETFLIX INC,COP26: What is the 1.5 degrees Celcius climate change target? What will happen if the world goes past 1.5 degrees of global warming?,"""The world is changing, the planet’s heating up. What the f*** is going on?” sings Bo Burnham in his acclaimed Netflix special, Outside.“You say the ocean’s rising like I give a s***,” he adds sardonically, “You say the whole world is ending, honey it already did.”  These lyrics resonate with the feeling of hopelessness shared by many around climate change. For some, it feels like we are hurtling towards man-made climate catastrophe and it is too late to do anything about it. In short: we’re screwed.As COP26 comes to an end in Glasgow, we’re soon to find out if that is indeed the case.The climate conference is widely viewed as humanity’s last chance to fix the mess we find ourselves in. A key part of any successful agreement would limit global warning to 1.5 degrees. But what does 1.5 degrees actually mean? Why is it so important? And would would happen if world temperatures rise beyond it?What is the 1.5 degree target? Why is it so important?Since the Industrial Revolution, the world’s average surface temperature has risen by around 1 degree Celsius. It might sound like a tiny number, but it has had an enormous impact on nature and human life. Glaciers and ice sheets have melted, sea levels have risen, and extreme weather events are on the rise.The vast majority of scientists agree that greenhouse gases, released into the atmosphere by human activity, are the cause of this warming.And scientists project that limiting warming to 1.5 degrees would reduce the worst impacts of climate change.The Paris Agreement adopted at COP21 had a goal of limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees – preferably 1.5 degrees Celsius. It was a legally binding international treaty adopted by 196 parties at the 2015 conference.Countries also agreed to limit their CO2 emissions to ‘net zero’ by 2050.  However, despite this landmark agreement, we are currently on track to a temperature rise of 2.4 degrees above pre-industrial levels before the end of the century. What will happen at 1.5 degrees of global warming?It’s important to remember, 1.5 degrees of global warming, while the best case scenario, is still quite grim. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts 1.5 degrees will see extreme heatwaves, oceans rising, and the destruction of 70 to 90 per cent of coral reefs.This is why the 1.5 figure is so important, because it is where the line must be drawn. A greater rise in temperature would be catastrophic…Read more: 10 Scottish species at risk due to climate changeWhat will happen at 2 degrees of global warming and beyond?What is the difference between 1.5 degrees and 2? Well, a lot, according to the IPCC. - At 2 degrees, seas will rise another 10cm on average by 2100 – causing flooding, habitat destruction, and dangerous weather events like hurricanes- 1.7 billion more people will experience severe heatwaves at least once every five years- 61 million more people in urban areas will be exposed to severe drought- Several hundred million more people could become exposed to climate-related risks and poverty- Coral reefs could decline as much as 99 per cent, sharply decreasing ocean biodiversity and impacting half a billion people- Animals, plants, and insects will lose more than half their habitats- Many species will go extinct – almost half the world’s species by 2100 if we carry on the way we are goingWhat have world leaders agreed at COP26? Are we on track for 1.5 degrees?World leaders are still negotiating a final deal at COP26, the most polluting conference of its kind, but a draft agreement has been released. It urges countries to “revisit and strengthen” targets for cutting emissions by 2030, to align them by the end of 2022 with the Paris goal of keeping temperature rises to “well below 2C” or to 1.5 degrees. Even if an agreement is reached, it will need countries to stick with it if there is any chance of warming staying below 1.5 degrees. And then there are the nations which haven’t attended COP26, like China and Russia. The world is watching: let’s wait and see.

Environmental charity Friends of the Earth also said Ms Sturgeon had refused to sign up for the group.BOGA, an international coalition of governments launched at COP26 yesterday, has pledged to work together to phase out oil and gas production.It is led by Costa Rica and Denmark, with France, Greenland, Ireland, Quebec, Sweden and Wales also signing up at the Glasgow climate summit.Speaking at COP26, the First Minister said: ""Obviously we've been in close dialogue and we are considering joining, which is quite obvious. But I'm sure if you were there, I'm sure you would know there are different categories of membership.""And if we're going to join an organisation, we need to do a rigorous assessment about if we were to join, what category of membership would best suit our circumstances.""So that's a process we are going through.I would expect that we may well associate ourselves with it in the not too distant future.""To use the terminology of the organisation's title, I've been very clear, it's not the easiest issue for Scotland given our oil and gas dependence right now, to say this.""But we do need to move beyond oil and gas as quickly as feasible.""But for somebody like me, the statement is the easy bit.""What we've got to do is make sure we do that in a way that is just and fair so that doesn't leave us more dependent on imported oil and gas, and crucially doesn't leave the 100,000 in Scotland who work in that sector on the economic scrapheap. So that's what we're focused on.""Scottish Greens climate spokesman Mark Ruskell said: ""I have raised the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance with ministers so I am glad Scotland is in discussions to be part of this progressive alliance, which is only going to grow over time.""It's a shame we are not signed up on day one, but I will continue to push ministers to be part of this critical initiative.""Friends of the Earth criticised Ms Sturgeon for posing with Greta Thunberg at COP26 then apparently snubbing the alliance.The charity's Scotland Director Dr Richard Dixon said: ""Nicola Sturgeon is keen to use the language of climate justice and be photographed with Greta Thunberg but at some point her fine rhetoric has to translate into a commitment to stopping the oil and gas production that is driving the climate crisis. Refusing to join the Alliance is a failure to follow through on her Government's recent change of position to no longer support unlimited oil and gas extraction.""Instead of siding with oil and gas companies, the Scottish Government must ensure that people and communities working in oil and gas are at the heart of planning a fair and fast phase-out of fossil fuels, whilst scaling up renewable energy to help create decent green jobs.""But for the Scottish Conservatives, shadow net zero secretary Liam Kerr said: ""This is an admission that the SNP-Green Government are abandoning Scotland's oil and gas industry. Beyond Oil and Gas are committed to a dramatic shift away from fossil fuels.""By opening discussions with them, Nicola Sturgeon is signalling her intent to put thousands of Scottish jobs on a cliff edge.""Spurred on by her anti-business Green partners, the First Minister's actions threaten livelihoods across north-east Scotland.""Deirdre Michie, CEO of Oil and Gas UK, said pulling the rug from under the industry's feet would actually damage the drive towards a greener economy.She added: ""The UK's offshore oil and gas industry is helping aid the energy transition underway.""While we still need oil and gas, it is far better we meet our own demand with our own resources rather than importing it, which can be far worse for the environment.""Putting an arbitrary end to supply and production would damage livelihoods across Scotland - the same communities whose skills will be vital in helping us achieve a low-carbon economy.""OPINION: PAGE 12DELEGATES BOOSTED AIRPORT'S EMISSIONS THREE TIMES OVERCOP26 is set to generate nearly triple the emissions of Glasgow Airport last year.A report for the UK Government says the summit is on course to emit about 102,500 tonnes of CO2 equivalent, with about 60 per cent of that solely from international flights.Glasgow Airport reported total comparable emissions of 36,885 tonnes last year. The average person in the UK is responsible for about seven tonnes a year, and the venues on the SEC produce around 6,659 tonnes.Boris Johnson, US President Joe Biden and Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos have all faced criticism for luxury flights to and from COP26.Dr Doug Parr of Greenpeace UK said: ""The failure to reach any meaningful agreement about limiting aviation's vast emissions at a conference where 60 per cent of the emissions came from aviation really highlights the lack of equity in these talks. Countries should ban short-haul flights wherever a viable alternative already exists, and invest in rail to create a transport system that's good for the planet, affordable and accessible to all.""Scottish Labour net zero spokeswoman Monica Lennon said: ""If COP26 is to deliver the bold change needed, those involved should lead by example.""The UK Government has pledged to use carbon offsetting, where reductions are made to offset emissions elsewhere, to make COP26 carbon neutral.'She intends to put thousands of Scottish jobs on a cliff edge'LIAM KERR",Copyright 2021 Express Newspapers All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|DXPscot|ENGLISH|SEA LTD|NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING & BROADCASTING & WEB SEARCH PORTALS|SE (NYSE)|Scotland|ENERGY & UTILITY POLICYGOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONPUBLIC POLICYTALKS & MEETINGSASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONSUK POLITICAL PARTIESSCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTYIMPORT TRADEALLIANCES & PARTNERSHIPSBUSINESS & PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONSENVIRONMENTAL & WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONSPETROLEUM EXPORTS & IMPORTS|ENERGY & UTILITY POLICYOIL & GAS INDUSTRYENERGY & UTILITIESOIL & GAS REGULATION & POLICYPETROLEUM EXPORTS & IMPORTS|NICOLA STURGEON|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|ATLANTIC OCEANNORTH SEA|SCOTLANDDENMARKFRANCEGREENLANDUNITED KINGDOMWALES",SE (NYSE)

Campaigners say that sum is anyway woefully inadequate.A first draft published on Wednesday merely ""urges"" developed countries to ""urgently scale up"" aid to help poorer ones adapt to climate change, and calls for more funding through grants rather than loans, which add to debt burdens.China, the world's biggest producer of greenhouse gases, has gradually accepted more responsibility for its emissions from an economy that has grown beyond measure in the last two decades. U.S. climate envoy John Kerry and his Chinese counterpart, Xie Zhenhua, unveiled a joint declaration late Wednesday in which China, the biggest producer and user of coal, promised to accelerate its transition from the dirtiest fossil fuel.The deal between two global powers, which have been divided by many diplomatic disputes on other issues, sent a powerful message to COP26, including the producers of the fossil fuels that are the main cause of man-made global warming.Although scant on numbers, leaders said it offered a strong signal to other countries and could persuade them to do more to seal agreement at the summit.""This is a boost to negotiations as we go into the final days of COP26 and continue working to deliver an ambitious outcome for the planet,"" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Twitter.Kerry said during a news conference: ""Together we set out our support for a successful COP26, including certain elements which will promote ambition.""A joint declaration said China, home to half the world's coal-fired plants, would begin phasing out its coal consumption from 2026-30 and also cut its emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide.Observers had been worried before the announcement that Chinese President Xi Jinping was not attending the talks in Glasgow, and Beijing had made no substantial new pledges.China's climate plan had also not addressed its methane emissions, linked largely to its sprawling coal industry.The U.S. has set a goal to decarbonize its economy by 2050, although President Joe Biden has been struggling to pass crucial legislation to do so through a politically divided Congress.""It's really encouraging to see that those countries that were at odds in so many areas have found common ground on what is the biggest challenge humanity faces today,"" EU climate policy chief Frans Timmermans said.

12,COP26: A Yorkshire climate activist’s view from summit and challenge to Drax – Daniel Willis,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Yorkshire Post,News,792,COLUMNISTS,792,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Daniel Willis,,DRAX GROUP PLC,DRAX GROUP PLC,COP26: A Yorkshire climate activist’s view from summit and challenge to Drax – Daniel Willis,"Attending the talks as a civil society observer for the first time this year, I was struck by the fast pace of change and wall-to-wall media attention on the talks. COP26: Our moral duty to save the planet we call home – The Yorkshire Post saysBut a big challenge remains in terms of how the significance of the talks, and what they will mean for people’s everyday lives, will be communicated to the wider public.How climate crisis response will define this generation – The Yorkshire Post saysThe COP (a meeting between countries signed up to the United Nations convention on climate change) is a place where global targets and frameworks are set. The decisions made this week will not immediately impact the lives of the public – that’s down to how our national and local governments interpret these agreements. But that doesn’t mean that what’s been agreed this week won’t have impacts in the long term.We have seen a wave of pledges to cut end deforestation, cut methane emission, and shift public and private sector finances away from fossil fuels into renewable energy. Yet, right now, many of these remain just pledges without firm plans behind them.In the months and years to come, plans to cut carbon emissions from coal power and stop deforestation could have a big impact here in Yorkshire, not least because of the Drax power plant. Drax has been called both the UK’s most polluting project and Europe’s biggest green experiment, as it gradually shifts from burning coal to create electricity to burning biomass (natural products like wood) instead. But groups have criticised the station for actually increasing its emissions and for contributing to deforestation by burning materials that come from trees.As the Government tries to implement pledges made at COP, it is really important that a plan is put in place that quickly reduces Drax’s contribution to climate change, and cuts its contribution to deforestation, without resulting in job losses. One way of guaranteeing this would be for the Government to engage more closely with local communities in Yorkshire, to provide funds and retraining programmes to support workers, and to develop more green energy projects across the county. By doing this, the UK can meet its international commitments agreed with some of the countries most affected by climate change at COP26, without forcing the costs onto families and communities.Another important way of supporting communities while reducing emissions from fossil fuels is to develop low carbon public transport. Yorkshire can be a difficult region to travel across easily without a car, so improving and expanding our public transport infrastructure while ensuring it runs on clean energy could be good for both people and planet. Significant public investment in public transport can also reduce the costs of using it, meaning that more people are freely able to travel and work across the region. Similarly, we should invest in developing cycling infrastructure and make our cities easier to walk around, a process that needs to involve (and in some towns already is doing) proper public consultation and engagement. Done right, these changes won’t just help us tackle climate change, they will also support the economic development of the region.Having a positive vision of how tackling climate change might improve all of our lives is essential for reducing the global impacts of global warming while keeping the public onside. Many in the climate justice movement would call this a \u2028“just transition” – meaning a shift to more sustainable ways \u2028of living while improving our lives and achieving justice for \u2028all. With more public transport, green jobs and a greater emphasis on caring for our families and green spaces, we would have more time and resources to enjoy life and spend time with our families and friends.It was heartening to see thousands of people in Leeds, York, Sheffield and across the UK march in support of this kind of positive vision.Of course, the costs of creating this kind of change, while reducing carbon emissions and supporting low income countries through extreme weather, droughts and floods, will be significant. But they will still be far less than the costs of not taking action at all. That is why the coming weeks and months after COP26 will be critical.Daniel Willis lives in Huddersfield and campaigns for climate justice at Global Justice Now.Support The Yorkshire Post and become a subscriber today.

14,"COP26 summit: 1.5C in 'mortal peril', world leaders warned","November 12, 2021 Friday",International,standard.co.uk,News,666,"NEWS,UK;Version:1",666,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"Nicholas Cecil,Rachael Burford and David Bond",,,,"COP26 summit: 1.5C in 'mortal peril', world leaders warned","World leaders were warned on Friday that their latest COP26  draft deal leaves the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C in ""mortal peril"".Scientists  say achieving this target  is crucial to avoid the more catastrophic scenario of floods, fires and heatwaves from climate change.  But a new draft agreement, published early on Friday, failed to deliver any dramatic breakthrough on curbing harmful greenhouse gas emissions.Talks were still ongoing and there was a growing expectation that they could now run into Saturday, after the planned end of COP26.Boris Johnson had set the ambition for the summit in Glasgow to ""keep alive"" the 1.5C goal, which in itself has been criticised as failing to address the urgency of the crisis.Shortly after the latest document was published, shadow business secretary Ed Miliband, who was a leading player in Britain's team at COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009, said: ""It's clear that the aim of this summit to keep 1.5 alive is in mortal peril."" The changes include:                                            Rather than calling for countries ""to accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels"", it now urges them to accelerate the shift to clean energy systems by ""accelerating the phase out of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels"".                       Countries are now ""requested"" rather than ""urged"" to ""revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets"" in their national action plans by the end of 2022 to align with global goals to limit temperature rises to ""well below"" 2C and try to limit them to 1.5C.                       Michael Jacobs, a former climate adviser to Gordon Brown, said: ""I see this as a strengthening of the language which effectively means countries are being told to come back next year with nationally determined contributions aligned to the 1.5C temperature goal."" But Greenpeace International executive director Jennifer Morgan disagreed, saying: ""It's even weaker now.""                       A pledge that richer nations will give the poorest countries $100 billion (£73 billion) a year, which should have happened by now, to help them tackle climate change and make their industries greener also appears to have been watered down. The latest version is better ""balanced"" towards recognising the climate change threats facing developing countries. A new qualifying clause to the section on updating 2030 targets includes that this ""requested"" action ""takes into account different national circumstances"".                                        Asked if the draft meets or falls short of his hopes for Glasgow, climate expert Lord Stern said: ""It falls short of what one would hope for in the sense of really driving to 1.5C and tackling clean development. But I think it goes beyond where I thought it might be a few days ago when we saw the one before.""The peer, who led the 2006 Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, added: ""I think this new text is stronger, has a greater sense of urgency, looking at all forms of finance, and the importance of getting it in place next year, when we have to both deliver on the $100 billion and put in place something which is much bigger and better.""Dr Thomas Hale, associate Professor in Public Policy at Oxford's Blavatnik School of Government, said: ""If you look at the whole package we have seen some progress towards limiting emissions. But we need to see much more next year (at the next COP in Egypt) in order to keep 1.5C alive.""Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she would not ""bet lots of money"" on the talks being completed by the 6pm deadline. She told the BBC the agreement was in ""many respects slightly better than the draft that was published earlier in the week, but it still has a way to go"".

15,Eight arrested on penultimate day of COP26 as protesters target Glasgow buildings,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Herald Scotland,News,485,,485,Scotland,Herald Scotland Online,,,,Eight arrested on penultimate day of COP26 as protesters target Glasgow buildings,"A further eight people were arrested on the penultimate day of COP26 including protesters at the Scottish Power building.During one protest climate change activists threw paint over the Scottish Power building in Glasgow as demonstrations continue during the crucial COP26 conference.The protesters, from Scientist Rebellion, glued their hands to the property and splattered the building with green paint to represent the \xE2greenwashing of Scottish Power\xE2.One activist taking part in the demonstration was pictured being held in the back of a police van while officers were seen removing others from the scene as the protest unfolded in St Vincent Street on Thursday.Assistant Chief Constable Gary Ritchie said: \xE2Eight people were arrested today with minimal disruption to the city centre and to the people who live and work there.\xE2A police spokesman added: \xE2The charges include a breach of the maritime restrictions, breach of the peace and malicious mischief.In response to the demonstration, a spokesperson for Scottish Power said: \xE2We respect people\xE2s right to protest, which has been an important part of COP26.\xE2However, we cannot condone malicious damage to our property, which, with its global warming stripes, is a very visible symbol of the climate change story, the science behind it, and the need to take action now.\xE2READ MORE:\xC2How the world's press saw Glasgow during global summitOn the same day, as people gathered at ceremonies around the country for Armistice Day, Extinction Rebellion activists were seen lying outside the COP26 venue under a banner reading \xE2climate crisis\xE2.Several of the demonstrators held placards, including Sue Lewis who was carrying a sign saying \xE2Remember Climate Death\xE2.Speaking about the protest, Ms Lewis said: \xE2This demonstration that we are doing, we\xE2ve chosen to do on Remembrance Day because as well as remembering all the people who have died in our conflict in the past, we also wanted to remember the people who have died from the climate crisis already, and also the many thousands who will die in the future, especially if this process at COP26does not succeed in improving the future for humanity.\xE2We are at Code Red, as the United Nations have said, and the future doesn\xE2t look good.\xE2Ms Lewis said she had been protesting with friends and colleagues for almost two weeks throughout the COP26 event.The international summit has drawn thousands of protesters to the city to make their voices heard as negotiations about global climate change policies have been held by world leaders.Ms Lewis added: \xE2We are trying to get our voices heard and we are trying to amplify the voices of the young people, the children, the people in the global south and the indigenous groups who aren\xE2t able to be here, we are trying to be here for them, and to get across the dire, dire situation that we are in.\xE2",Copyright 2021 NewsQuest Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|ARRESTSNEGATIVE MISC NEWSNEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWSNEGATIVE NEWSPROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONSCLIMATE CHANGECLIMATOLOGYDISORDERLY CONDUCTNEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSPOLICE FORCESTRENDS & EVENTSCONFERENCES & CONVENTIONSGREENWASHINGCLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION & POLICYGLOBAL WARMINGUNITED NATIONSDEATH & DYING|GREENWASHINGGLOBAL WARMINGEMERGENCY VEHICLES|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|SCOTLAND",
16,Glasgow summit: hits and misses from COP26 climate meet,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Indian Express,News,1088,,1088,"India, Republic of",Express Web Desk,,,,Glasgow summit: hits and misses from COP26 climate meet,"Here are some of the highlights from the 26th edition of United Nations Climate Change conference in Scotland.As the Glasgow climate conference draws to a close, there is much debate about the success of the 26th edition of United Nations Climate Change, popularly known as COP26.After nearly two weeks, the nearly 200 countries represented at the summit remain at odds over a range of issues from how rich nations should compensate poor ones for damage caused by climate-driven disasters to how often nations should be required to update their emissions pledges.Alok Sharma, the British leader serving as the president of the summit, said that there is a lot more work to be done. Meanwhile, Dubai announced that UAE will be hosting COP28 climate conference in 2023. The 2022 COP will be hosted by another Middle-Eastern country, namely Egypt.The core aim of the COP26 conference was to keep alive the 2015 Paris Agreement's aspirational target to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels and avoid the worst impacts of climate change. But under countries' current pledges to cut emissions this decade, researchers say the world would hit levels of global warming far beyond that limit, unleashing catastrophic sea level rises, floods and droughts.Here are some of the hits and misses at the conference:India's announcement to achieve net zero carbon emission by 2070India pledged to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2070. The statement was delivered by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who made five major announcements at Glasgow. These are: a) India will produce 500 GW of non-fossil fuel energy by 2030, b) India will have 50 per cent renewable energy in its energy mix by 2030, c) India will reduce its emissions intensity from 35 per cent to 45 per cent by 2030, d) reduce India's carbon emissions by one billion tonnes by 2030.China, US announce plan to work together to cut down methane emissionsIn an unexpected bilateral agreement between US and China, Beijing has promised to finalise a plan to reduce its methane emissions this decade. China had stayed away from a pledge that over 100 other countries had made last week - to make 30 per cent cut in methane emissions from current levels by 2030. US was part of that pledge. In the bilateral agreement, China has not taken any targets on methane emission cuts but only said it would work towards reducing it. But that is still being seen as a forward movement, considering that China is one of the biggest emitters of methane.Africa, India call for $1.3 tn per year in climate finance from rich nationsWhile developed countries have failed to put together even the $100 billion per year in climate financing as promised, African nations and some other developing countries, including India, have put a figure on the enhanced flow of finance that the developed world must deliver in the coming years - at least $1.3 trillion per year from 2030.A group of 24 nations that call themselves Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDCs), as well as countries from Africa, on Monday evening put forward this demand in a proposal for enhanced finance flows that they are pushing for inclusion in the final decisions that will be agreed at the climate conference in Glasgow.India is part of the LMDC grouping along with China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Iran, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, the Philippines and others.Climate talks back off from call to end all coal useNegotiators at this year's UN climate talks in Glasgow appeared to be backing away from a call to end all use of coal and phase out fossil fuel subsidies completely. The latest draft proposal from the meeting's chair released Friday calls on countries to accelerate ""the phaseout of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels.""Tuvalu minister stands in sea to film COP26 speech to show climate changeTuvalu's foreign minister has given a speech to the United Nations climate conference in Glasgow standing knee-deep in seawater to show how his low-lying Pacific island nation is on the front line of climate change.Images of Simon Kofe standing in a suit and tie at a lectern set up in the sea, with his trouser legs rolled up, have been shared widely on social media, drawing attention to Tuvalu's struggle against rising sea levels.More than 40 nations pledge to cut emissions from their health industriesMore than 40 countries have pledged to cut greenhouse-gas emissions across their health systems, World Health Organisation officials said late Monday, representing the largest global effort to date to try to reduce contributions by the world's hospitals and health care industry to global warming. The health care sector accounts for almost 5% of global carbon dioxide emissions. If it were a country, it would be the fifth largest emitterChina targets 1.8 per cent cut in average coal use at power plants by 2025China flagged on Wednesday it is targetting a 1.8 per cent reduction in average coal use for electricity generation at power plants over the next five years, in a bid to lower greenhouse gas emissions.The target, announced by China's economic planner, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), comes as the world's top climate negotiators have gathered in Scotland for the COP26 climate talks. Average coal use for electricity generation in China fell by about 17.4 per cent in the 15 years till 2020.Nearly 90 countries join pact to slash planet-warming methane emissionsNearly 90 countries have joined a US- and EU-led effort to slash emissions of the potent greenhouse gas methane 30% by 2030 from 2020 levels, a pact aimed at tackling one of the main causes of climate change, a senior Biden administration official said. The partnership will be formally launched later on Tuesday.Methane is the main greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. It has a higher heat-trapping potential than CO2 but breaks down in the atmosphere faster - meaning that cutting methane emissions can have a rapid impact on reining in global warming.Over 100 global leaders pledge to end deforestation by 2030More than 100 global leaders late on Monday pledged to halt and reverse deforestation and land degradation by the end of the decade, underpinned by $19 billion in public and private funds to invest in protecting and restoring forests.The joint statement at the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow was backed by the leaders of countries including Brazil, Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, which collectively account for 85% of the world's forests.","Copyright 2021 Indian Express, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved",,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|CLIMATE CHANGECLIMATOLOGYCONFERENCES & CONVENTIONSEMISSIONSGLOBAL WARMINGUNITED NATIONSAGREEMENTSGREENHOUSE GASESINTERNATIONAL RELATIONSINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS & NATIONAL SECURITYTREATIES & AGREEMENTSCARBON NEUTRAL INITIATIVESCLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION & POLICYGREEN FINANCEHEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENTENVIRONMENTAL ACCIDENTS & DISASTERSDEVELOPING COUNTRIESENERGY & ENVIRONMENTPRIME MINISTERS|EMISSIONSGLOBAL WARMINGENERGY & UTILITIESMETHANENATURAL GASCARBON NEUTRAL INITIATIVESGREEN FINANCEENERGY & ENVIRONMENTALTERNATIVE & RENEWABLE ENERGY|NARENDRA MODI|GLASGOW, SCOTLANDBEIJING, CHINA|DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATESNORTH CENTRAL CHINA|INDIACHINAAFRICAMIDDLE EASTUNITED ARAB EMIRATESUNITED KINGDOMSCOTLAND",

18,Inside fight to make Premier League clubs sustainable and follow the COP26 agenda,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,mirror.co.uk,News,2212,NEWS;Version:1,2212,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"By, Felix Keith",,TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR PLC,TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR PLC,Inside fight to make Premier League clubs sustainable and follow the COP26 agenda," On the face of things, the United Nations' Climate Change Conference feels pretty far removed from the Premier League.  While COP26 has been going on in Glasgow over these past few weeks, generating headlines, political fallout and alarming statistics aplenty, football has done what it does best for many: provide solace from the outside noise. When games are on, you can hone in on the action and forget about your worries and the worsening climate crisis which is unfolding worldwide.Except that all might be about to change -and with good reason.Football does not exist in a vacuum. It is a part of wider society and, as such, has a moral obligation to be involved in the fight against climate change.After all, it would not be able to continue if pitches were underwater, forest fires raged nearby and temperatures soared to uninhabitable levels.As the self-proclaimed best league in the world, the Premier League attracts plenty of eyeballs and therefore it can be a powerful conduit for change, if there is a will to do so.Luckily for all those keen on football, as well as avoiding catastrophic and irreversible damage to the planet, many Premier League clubs are determined to do their bit.                                            Game Zero                                        COP26 has brought the topic of climate change to the agenda over the past few weeks, but the issue of sustainability was actually at the forefront of the Premier League conversation before the conference.                     Tottenham 's match against Chelsea on September 19 was not just notable for the Blues' second-half demolition of Spurs in a 3-0 win; it was also branded as Game Zero, with the aim of being the world's first net zero carbon football game at an elite level. Spurs lost on the pitch, but off it they are leading the way in terms of sustainability.For the game, the clubs vowed to minimise emissions, increase recycling, promote greener methods of travel to and from the stadium and offer more vegetarian, vegan options to eat and offset any leftover emissions by planting trees. Meanwhile, rather than the usual pre-match chat, broadcaster Sky Sports opted to host discussions around the issue of sustainability.It was a small step, but one which organisers and campaigners hope will lead to many others in the right direction.One way it might encourage change is through competition, because as things stand Tottenham hold the title as the Premier League's greenest club. Alongside Liverpool, Arsenal and Southampton they have signed up to the UN's Sports for Climate Action Framework and came out top in the Green League, which was published by the BBC in January. Spurs' stadium is powered by 100 per cent renewable energy, single-use plastic has been phased out and their training ground was built on green belt land with the aim of becoming an ecological habitat. At the other end of the table for the most recent data are Aston Villa and Burnley, who both lag some way behind the pace set by Spurs. In a statement to The Mirror, Burnley said they were ""acutely aware of the negative impact that our activities can have on the environment"" and had implemented ""a number of initiatives to improve the sustainability of our operations"" to achieve the goal of ""a leader for sustainability"".Aston Villa pointed out its commitment to ""reducing its consumption of single-use plastics"" and plans to encourage ""all club staff to make use of water fountains with their own individual water bottles.""                                            The benchmark                                        For many, the words 'football' and 'sustainability' equals Forest Green Rovers. And the connection is well earned.Not only do they have 'green' in their name, Forest Green are leading the way at the forefront of the sustainability movement in sport.The League Two club laid claim to being the world's first vegan football club in 2017 and was officially named as the world's first UN certified carbon-neutral football club in 2018.The club's stadium is powered by renewable energy sources, they serve only vegan food, the players play on an organic pitch, wear a kit made from composable material and fans are encouraged to arrive via a park and ride scheme, electric cars and bicycles.Rainwater is collected and recycled, the pitch is cut by a solar-powered robotic lawnmower and all waste cooking oil is recycled into biofuel.The next steps are to build a 5,000-seater all wooden stadium on a green technology business park and take the groundsman's equipment fully electric.You can see why the Gloucestershire-based club are the undisputed posterboys of sustainability in football -and it is all down to chairman Dale Vince, who has used his expertise as owner of green energy company Ecotricity to lead the fight in sport.Vince insists he is not ""proud"" of his work over the past 11 years with Forest Green and says that the only part of the transformation which could be termed controversial was the switch from a traditional menu to a vegan-only one, something, he says, many saw as ""impossible"".""No one really cared that we put solar panels on the roof, or had charging points for electric cars. Nobody got riled up about that, but some did about the change in the menu,"" he tells The Mirror.""Most of the conversations I'm having with international sports clubs of any kind, that would be the thing that concerns them the most: 'How can we take our club vegan, without having a riot' That's what one American football club said to me. We've shown it can be done.""                                            The will to change                                        Forest Green have managed to reduce their yearly carbon emissions to just 30 tons, which they then offset. That is some achievement -and something which feels a long way off for Premier League clubs.But Vince is bullish when assessing the lay of the land. He does not see himself as a revolutionary, or what he is passionate about as being particularly innovative.To him it is common sense and mutually beneficial: it is kind to the planet, as well as the club, in both a financial and commercial sense.Vince says Forest Green's fanbase has grown fourfold since 2010, while the club now has 20 different fan groups worldwide. It has also helped on the pitch: the club finished 20th in the Conference in 2010/11 and, two promotions later, currently sit top of League Two.The 60-year-old is convinced that others further up the food chain can follow in Forest Green's footsteps.""It would be so easy for them,"" Vince believes. ""The amount of money involved would be nothing. It's not even that bad at our level. For those guys... it's just another league when it comes to money. It's another planet actually.""To get stuff like solar panels and charging points, even vegan options before going fully vegan, that's really easy for them.""Organic pitch Yeah. recycling, ban single-use plastics -all of that stuff doesn't actually cost money to do. They could do it -and we could help them if they want to.""We talk to Premier League clubs really frequently about one aspect or another of what we're doing. And we know there's real interest in football and in sport generally.""That overview is reflected by others who are also trying to implement change.Thom Rawson is head of sustainability at charity Football for Future and is working with clubs to turn good intentions into action.""I would describe the general atmosphere across Premier League clubs as they definitely want to do something,"" he tells The Mirror.""And they know that doing something on sustainability and climate change is essential for the future of what football is going to look like. But often they don't necessarily know what that means or where to start.""Russell Seymour, chief executive at the British Association for Sustainable Sport BASIS, agrees.""The last few months, it really has exploded. I imagine, depending on what comes out of COP26, there's probably going to be even more interest,"" he says. ""You can't escape it now. The lockdown has had an impact.""                                            The barriers                                        It seems, therefore, that the will to do something is there. The difficulty comes in turning that noble desire into action, because, as the news bulletins have made clear recently, time is running out. So what is preventing the Premier League from tackling the issue head onWell, there was a small news story from last month which provided a fitting example of one of the key problems. On Saturday, October 16 Manchester United faced Leicester City away in the Premier League. Rather than make the 100-mile trip by coach, United decided to fly due to ""circumstances"", understood to be reports of congestion on the M6. Their completely unnecessary journey lasted just 10 minutes. United are doing some admirable work on sustainability and are joint second in the 2020 Green League, yet their stance did not translate into action that day.""I think that shows a disconnect between the club and the football side,"" Vince says. ""On the club side, they talk a good game about the environment but then they went and made that crazy decision.""For Seymour, of BASIS, the example showed there is still plenty of work that needs to be done around the practicalities of sustainability, which is still not normalised in clubs' decision making processes.As Vince has explained, making greener decisions can often save money, due to greater efficiency, but the perception that being more sustainable means greater expenditure is a barrier.                                             HAVE YOUR SAY! Is your club doing enough on sustainability issues Comment below.                                         ""It's not cost prohibitive,"" says Rawson, who is also chief sustainability officer at Hanwell Town FC. ""It's about sustainability not being built into the decision making process at the club. But what is a barrier is the perception that pursuing sustainability costs a lot of money and requires a lot of investment.""Rawson and Seymour both believe that the lack of a sustainability-focused person in high level roles is a problem. At present, City Football Group, the umbrella organisation behind Man City, are one of few clubs to employ a director of sustainability.In response to The Mirror's question about whether they planned to hire a sustainability officer, Tottenham said they ""consider it a key part of every department's responsibility"". That is a valid stance, but one which Seymour disagrees with.""But just because everybody can use an excel spreadsheet, it doesn't mean you should sack the accountant,"" he says.                                            Society's role                                        Ultimately, the biggest barrier to greater emphasis on sustainability in the Premier League is the prevailing attitudes in this country.Football reflects wider society and, as the progress at COP26 shows, there remain plenty of problems, conflicts of interest and procrastinating on that front.And while this is the biggest problem of them all, it is also the biggest area of opportunity for football clubs to help bridge the gap.Addressing the fundamental, practical issues -renewable energy, waste management, plant-based food -is important for clubs, but not as important as using their unrivalled platform to influence the behaviours of their fanbase.""There are two things we're talking about here. One is football clubs reducing their impacts on the environment and their carbon footprint, which is important,"" Rawson explains.""The other side, which is so much more powerful, is football not just trying to minimise its own impact, but trying to use the power of football and the attention of the world that it has to change society, the economy and the way that people understand these issues.""Football clubs can't become [carbon] net zero in isolation from wider society and the economy, because it relies on the infrastructure around societal choices, behaviours of fans and the general public.""""It needs to influence wider society and the economy towards making that transition.""""It's absolutely key to engage fans and make it normal,"" Seymour adds. ""Have these conversations, take on feedback. Fans will become more demanding as they understand this more and change things in their own lives.""So, should we be hopeful that the Premier League is on the right trackVince remains determined to fight the good fight. ""I don't need hope to sustain me,"" he says. ""I am driven, so I just carry on.""Rawson is working directly with Premier League clubs, including Tottenham and Chelsea, and is seeing a change in attitudes.""We're in a growth area and we're really starting to see that happen,"" he says. ""We're starting to see the penny drop for a lot of clubs.""Seymour started BASIS 10 years ago. To begin with, he says, they were ""pretty much a lone voice"" on the subject. Now momentum is being built.""I think society is changing,"" he says. ""We have to change. Sport reflects society. We both reflect it and are a part of it.""It's all going in the right direction. We will respond to what the fans want and all the pressures that are around us. I am hopeful.""",Copyright 2021 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper; Web Publication|WEBDMI|ENGLISH|TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR PLC|NAICS711211 SPORTS TEAMS & CLUBSSIC7941 PROFESSIONAL SPORTS CLUBS & PROMOTERS|CLIMATE CHANGEPROFESSIONAL SPORTSSPORTS & RECREATIONUNITED NATIONSCONFERENCES & CONVENTIONSEMISSIONSSUSTAINABILITYUNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONSNEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSSPORTS & RECREATION EVENTSSTADIUMS & ARENASWILDFIRESFOREST FIRESMEAT FREE DIETS|EMISSIONSALTERNATIVE & RENEWABLE ENERGYENERGY & UTILITIESSINGLE USE PLASTICS|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND",

22,Triple Bottom Line: COP26 - the call to action went to voicemail,"November 12, 2021 Friday",U.S. Federal,University Wire,News,1102,OPINION;Pg. 1,1102,,,,,,Triple Bottom Line: COP26 - the call to action went to voicemail,"(Lauren Schatzman | Daily Trojan)Hello Friday readers, welcome to my column! I got an extension on this week's article to more comprehensively assess the success of this year's global climate conference - some may call it procrastination - they aren't wrong - but I call it good journalism! At the time of this article's publication, the 26th annual United Nations Conference of the Parties, held in Glasgow, Scotland, will have just closed.The UN has hosted these annual global climate change summits for more than two decades. Negotiators, government representatives, businesses and citizens from countries around the world meet in a designated host city for two weeks to focus on implementing the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.Arguably, climate conferences are the ultimate high-stakes group project. But, if all the group members don't get their act together, the damage will be a lot more irreparable than a bad grade. Instead of missed deadlines, rescheduled meetings and some light ghosting, the consequences include increased global temperatures, a more rapidly changing climate, increased wealth disparities, rampant food insecurity and more intense weather patterns, just to name a few.Because of the pandemic, COP26 was the first international climate conference held since 2019, so the pressure was on. Regarded as the world's ""last best hope"" for avoiding the worst of climate change, the conference invited delegates from 195 countries to Scotland with the hopes of creating methodologies to meet the 2015 Paris Agreement goal: limit the global average temperature increase over the preindustrial era to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2050.The United Kingdom claimed the event was destined to be ""the most inclusive COP ever,"" yet the reality was far from the truth. Perhaps the best way to sum up the achievements over those two weeks was a recent Tweet from climate activist Greta Thunberg: ""#COP26 has been named the [most] excluding COP ever. This is no longer a climate conference. This is a Global North greenwash festival. A two week celebration of business as usual...""Thunberg is not alone in accusing Glasgow of being exclusionary. Thanks to capitalist priorities and pandemic limitations, conference regulations were more stringent than ever. Between travel restrictions and extraordinarily high lodging costs, developing nations and nonprofits found it unusually difficult and expensive to attend the conference. Prices were hiked even higher because of labor and supply shortages caused by the pandemic and Brexit.Developing countries' lack of participation created an even greater power imbalance and failed to account for their interests in negotiations. Even as major world leaders from high emitters such as Russia and China failed to attend, the absence of Global South representation resulted in a disproportionate and ineffective power dynamic.Additionally, pandemic protocols effectively gatekept one of the conference's most important aspects - civic engagement. While the civil society's participation is a keystone aspect of climate conferences, social distancing and limited seating at open forums only heightened feelings of exclusion. Aspiring attendees were regularly stuck in hours-long lines, bogged down by travel red lists and encountered wheelchair-accessibility issues. While protests and demonstrations continued in the city's streets, activists felt that their social movements were disconnected from the conference itself.In general, capitalism fuels disparities at climate conferences, and COP26 was no exception. The conference's location, the accessibility of translators at forums, the conference's general content and most organizational decisions benefit developed countries in the Global North over the developing nations of the Global South.Because of difficulties in obtaining vaccines and visas and receiving a literal seat at the table for negotiations, the voices of those at the forefront of climate change's impact failed to be heard. And, hybrid events were of little to no benefit to countries and territories with minimal internet access.COP26 was a predictable disappointment that shows us just how counterintuitive global climate conferences are in attempting to produce tangible international progress. The bread and circuses of global climate conferences yield little substance; instead, they are an energy- and resource-intensive, commercialized photo opportunity for world leaders while activists and nonprofits congregate outside pleading for progress.While many climate change demonstrations have showed the collective power of social movements, they also served as frustrating reminders that progress is limited without the legitimate cooperation of government leaders.Despite our yearly optimism, Glasgow reminded us that transparency, accessibility and political progress fall to the backburner at climate conferences - global leaders preach aggressive climate action and make bold declarations, only to follow them up with watered-down resolutions and apathetic, nonbinding legislation. The gap between promise and policy continues to grow, as does the divide and distrust between the Global North and South.I'm no stranger to a lackluster group project - I've had my fair share of late nights picking up the slack for group mates and scrambling to assemble a presentation before the deadline. However, that's not an option when it comes to the climate crisis. Stopping or even slowing climate change's effects requires legitimate commitment from every nation.A group is only as strong as its weakest link, and if that link emits record-high amounts of greenhouse gases, the success of our efforts will be incredibly limited.Regarding the UN, coordinating representatives from around the world with different priorities, languages and cultures is incredibly difficult. Although the United States and China made progress by announcing their cooperation in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, they have not clarified the agreement's specifics yet. Despite the limited international progress that came out of the conference, the real outcomes have already become clear.The sparse guest list, ableism, lack of equitable arrangements for developing nations and closed doors to civil society at COP26 showed a lack of regard for adequate representation and set our course further away from the international cooperation we desperately need for effective climate intervention.Montana Denton is a senior writing about environmental issues, sustainability and society.

[Photo/Agencies]COP26 President Alok Sharma issued delegates with a call to action on the penultimate day of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties in Glasgow on Thursday, saying much work needs to be done to achieve a consensus on climate goals.Negotiators have hammered out multilateral plans on global warming since Nov 1 in the Scottish city, and the conference is due to end on Friday, though previous iterations have run over.COP26 has delivered some notable deals on deforestation, fossil fuel subsidies, coal and methane reduction, and engagement with the private and finance sectors. And on Wednesday, China and the United States surprised the conference with a joint declaration on climate change, which was roundly welcomed by onlookers.Simon Bradshaw, head of research at the Australia-based Climate Council, called the declaration ""a big deal"".""One of the big fears going into Glasgow is that China and the US would be at loggerheads, but in fact what this statement says is they will collaborate, despite their differences,"" Bradshaw said.But Sharma said ""another gear shift"" is needed to bring COP26 over the line, and voiced concern that there was still divergence over elements within working texts for the so-called Glasgow Agreement, a draft of which was issued midweek.""I'm under no illusion that any party in this room is wholly satisfied with where the texts currently stand,"" Sharma said. ""We are not there yet, there's still a lot more work to be done.""A new draft is expected on Thursday night. When finalized, the text will include commitments and measures aimed at limiting the rise in average global temperate and accelerating the transition to net-zero emissions.Sharma highlighted key unresolved areas, including climate adaptation, transparency, and finance, as well as the completion of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which concerns carbon markets and other cross-border mechanisms.The failure last year of rich nations to honor a commitment to provide $100 billion in annual climate finance to developing countries-a goal that was missed by $20 billion-remains a contentious issue.The draft text also called for acceleration in phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies this decade, a clause absent from previous COP agreements.A block of 24 nations, including China, called the Like-Minded Group of Developing Countries, or the LMDC, said the addition unfairly shifted responsibility to poor nations from rich ones, at a time when climate finance commitments remain unfulfilled.""Under the Paris Agreement finance is an obligation, finance is not a charity to developing countries from the developed world,"" Bolivian negotiator Diego Pacheco Balanza said, speaking on behalf of the LMDC.Thursday saw a number of fresh partnerships and announcements in Glasgow. The UK launched an Urban Climate Action Program that, backed with $36.8 million in funding, will help the net-zero transition in cities in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. And 11 nations and regions signed on to a Denmark and Costa Rica-led alliance aimed at phasing out the production of oil and gas.",Copyright 2021 China Daily Information.

Yury Sentyurin, Secretary General of the GECF who led the Forum's delegation, said: ""Given technology's pivotal role in transforming the energy industry, we recommend that the COP26 negotiations are underpinned by technology transfer to decarbonise the energy sector, including the decarbonisation technologies of the gas industry.""Gas is the cleanest of all fossil fuels, and its abundance, flexibility, and affordability makes it an ideal fuel of choice, particularly for emerging and developing economies, many of them in highly populated regions of Asia and Africa. Latest GECF figures estimate natural gas to become the most used source of energy in the world by 2050, upping its share from 23 percent today to 27 percent. ""Ensuring access to competitive and reliable energy sources is of paramount importance for a sustained economic recovery,"" noted Sentyurin, whose organisation is an Observer to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the organiser of the Conference of the Parties (COP). The official also outlined the steps being taken by the GECF Member Countries, from technology and innovation to research and development, in order to cement the role of natural gas as a solution for a balanced energy transition. ""Our Environmental Knowledge and Solutions framework has been initiated as a collaborative platform with designed measures to build capabilities and exchange expertise, specifically regarding greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions mitigation practices.""The GECF Member Countries have placed climate action at the forefront of their priorities,"" he added. The GECF Member Countries are Algeria, Bolivia, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Iran, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Russia, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela, whilst Angola, Azerbaijan, Iraq, Malaysia, Norway, Peru, and the United Arab Emirates are Observer Members. Together, the group represents 70 percent of the proven gas reserves, 44 percent of its marketed production, 52 percent of pipeline, and 51 percent of LNG exports across the globe. Representing the Russian Federation, Alexey Overchuk, Deputy Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation cited the energy landscape of the world's largest country by landmass as an example for other countries. ""86 percent of our energy generation is based on solar, wind, natural gas, nuclear and hydroelectric power. Russia is already an example of low GHG emissions,"" said Overchuk. The Russian official also spoke in favour of ending discrimination against other countries, so that every state has access to clean technologies. Responding to this theme of discrimination, Ali Salajegheh, Vice President and Head of the Department of Environment of the Islamic Republic of Iran urged for lifting of coercive measures on the western Asian country. ""These coercive measures and sanctions, in explicit contravention to global sustainable development agenda and relevant multilateral agreements, have consequences beyond our national context, hence, contributing to global warming.""Meanwhile, Qatar, another GECF Member and host of the Headquarters of the GECF, affirmed its National Environment and Climate Change Strategy at COP26. HE Sheikh Faleh bin Nasser al Thani, Minister of Environment and Climate Change of the State of Qatar told delegates that Qatar's strategy for environment and climate change is based on five main pillars: reducing GHG emissions and air pollutants, enhancing the abundance of biodiversity, establishing sustainable water management, improving waste management, building a circular economy, and enhancing land use productivity. Qatar has also promised the first carbon-neutral FIFA World Cup™ next year. The GECF has been an active participant of the Conference of Parties platform, joining COP24, COP25, and COP26.

It\xE2s about delivering on some of the things that haven\xE2t been delivered, like the \xC2100 billion of finance. So in that context there has been some strengthening that I welcome.He added: \xE2The problem that remains for me in the text is there is ambiguity\xE2 the Paris goals were to keep global warming to well below 2C and make efforts to keep it to 1.5C, and there is ambiguity in the text about whether we are coming back for the former goal or the latter goal. So that needs strengthening if at all possible.\xE2He said the 1.5C target is \xE2in mortal peril, and we\xE2re going to have to do some things very differently in the next 12 months from the previous two years if we\xE2re going to change things\xE2.He added: \xE2We\xE2ve got to do better on delivering this \xC2100 billion.

So hopefully we\xE2ll see that change.\xE2And still the fact that, although there is a recognition that 1.5 degrees is the goal, we are way off track to actually meet that, we\xE2re still on a track for a world of 2.4 degrees global warming.

We are nowhere near ambitious enough","November 12, 2021 Friday",International,standard.co.uk,News,549,"COMMENT,COMMENT;Version:1",549,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Caroline Lucas,,,,"In the second week of COP26, the mood turned dark. We are nowhere near ambitious enough","No one comes to Glasgow  in November expecting blue skies and sunshine but it was still a bit dispiriting to wake up to high winds and heavy rain on Saturday, when thousands of us were marching through the city for climate justice. It was hugely uplifting though to join climate activists, scientists, students, faith groups, Green politicians and others in what was the biggest demonstration in Scotland in living memory, and just one of dozens of climate marches across the UK  - and when a rainbow lit up the sky at one point it really did feel like a symbol of the hope rising from the crowds. Every day at COP26  has a theme and Monday's was loss and damage. This has been the Cinderella issue of climate negotiations, ignored or overlooked by rich nations who are failing to address the huge losses which climate-vulnerable countries  are already facing. I gave an interview to Sky News and made the point that climate finance is a cause of huge mistrust, with poorer countries getting far less than they were promised. The UNFCCC process doesn't attach any specific funding to Loss and Damage - and I heard delegates from countries like Barbados rightly call out the UK for not making anything like enough progress on this. The star on Tuesday was Little Amal, a giant puppet of a Syrian refugee child who has walked across Europe to focus attention on the needs of young refugees. By coming to Glasgow, she highlighted the climate emergency's impact on the refugee crisis. It was profoundly moving seeing her ""walk"" through crowds - and even more so to shake her by the hand. A packed schedule of side events and fringe meetings about the link between climate breakdown and our growth obsessed economic system.Mid-way through the second week and the mood music has darkened. The first draft of the final agreement mentions fossil fuels for the first time in a climate summit text. But it's nothing like ambitious enough. The key objective of this summit was to keep 1.5C alive - but the commitments made so far mean we're on course for at least 2.4 degrees. Boris Johnson turns up to chivvy negotiators. We want to move beyond hydrocarbons, he says, but refuses to say if the UK will join Denmark and Costa Rica in an alliance stopping future oil and gas production. Crossed the river to visit the summit's Green Zone which from what I saw is mostly a shrine to greenwash - Sainsbury's running sessions on food poverty and Formula One flogging electric racing cars. Thursday is a day of media interviews and catching up on emails. I bumped into Ed Miliband on my way to a meeting about the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty, a really exciting idea to get countries to sign up to leaving fossil fuels where they belong - in the ground. Then jumping online for an ""ask me anything"" with the Independent - answering questions on everything from the climate emissions from the military sector to what happens when everyone has gone home from Glasgow. Which of course is the million dollar question.

Carbon markets, 'nature based solutions' and 'net zero by the middle of the century' are all ways for them to get out of making the real emissions cuts we need to prevent climate catastrophe.""Scottish politicsJamie Livingstone, head of Oxfam Scotland, said: ""The most glaring omission is the lack of a global finance plan to help countries who are already dealing with the irreversible impacts of climate change.""Simply 'acknowledging' loss and damage will not bring back the submerged homes, poisoned fields and lost loved ones. During COP, Scotland became the first rich nation in the world to commit funds for loss and damage.""Other rich countries must now follow our lead, stop blocking progress and commit to doing something about it.""Emission reduction targets over the next decade have us careering towards climate catastrophe. We need an unambiguous deal in Glasgow that commits governments to coming back next year, and every year after that, with improved targets that will keep the goal of 1.5 degrees alive.""This is the final countdown.

Those include cutting fossil fuel pollution fast and soon enough to sharply rein in the Earth's warming, and demands for the U.S. and other developed nations historically responsible for much of climate change to provide financial aid to developing countries.In a statement, diplomats of the Marshall Islands in the Pacific said sticking to an emissions-cutting target that would allow theirs and other island nations to survive must be the ""North star"" for any deal.They also demanded an end to government subsidies for fossil fuels, and doubling of financial support to help less-developed nations deal with climate change.Kerry went out a different door after the talks and did not speak to reporters. Timmermans, asked about his mood on the last day of scheduled talks, pulled down his face mask to show his smile.___GLASGOW, Scotland - Alok Sharma  the British official presiding over this year's U.N. climate talks, has dismissed suggestions that he is trying to ratchet up pressure on negotiators in an effort to get them to seal a deal at the Glasgow meeting.""I think people have sometimes described me as 'no drama Sharma',"" he said Thursday, barely cracking a smile.Sharma said the draft agreements already circulated showed that ""a lot has been achieved.""""But we are still some way away from finalizing those very critical issues which have been outstanding,"" he added. ""And I don't think we can overemphasize how difficult this is.

37,"At COP26, a performance by mother-son duo from Kolkata","November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Times of India (TOI),News,466,KOLKATA,466,"India, Republic of",Priyanka Dasgupta,,,,"At COP26, a performance by mother-son duo from Kolkata","Kolkata: A mother-son duo from Kolkata is performing at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow on Thursday. The programme has been organized by the COP26 events and venue coordinator of Stop Climate Chaos Scotland. Bharatnatyam dancer and choreographer Sohini Roychowdhury will be performing along with son Rishi Dasgupta on acoustic guitar at an iconic Baroque church called Adelaide Place on Thursday. In a world ravaged by the pandemic, this two-week summit is a critical test of global cooperation to address climate crisis. COP stands for Conference of the Parties. In diplomatic parlance, the parties refer to 197 nations that agreed to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at a meeting in 1992. Apart from the likes of Joe Biden and Narendra Modi, more than 130 heads of state and government and thousands of diplomats have met to set new targets for cutting emissions that are heating the planet.Sohini with son Rishi Describing her invitation to perform on the sidelines as part of COP26 cultural expressions as the ""turning point"" of her life, Roychowdhury said, ""I was approached by Tami Pein who is the COP26 Events and Venue Coordinator of Stop Climate Chaos Scotland. This invitation means the world to me and am honoured to be performing at the most important climate-related conference on the planet. As a Kolkatan, I feel proud that my son and I have received this opportunity."" This is the first time the mother and son will perform together at a physical event. Dasgupta is studying economics at St Andrews University in Scotland. Roychowdhury believes her long association with 'Nature and I' projects might have influenced her selection as one of the performers. This project has been presented in the form of dance workshops, concerts and storytelling with dance formats both in Kolkata and various cities of Europe. ""Twelve years back, I had worked with students of 14 schools in Hampshire on this project. Discussions regarding it again came up recently when Amish Tripathi launched my book, 'Dancing with the Gods', in London and at my workshops in SOAS University of London,"" she said from Glasgow. The 20-minute-long programme will see the duo perform a version of 'Nature and Us' by using Shiva stotrams. The idea is to use references to various tales of Shiva to show the rage of nature to how it heals to restore a balance in this universe. ""There is an umbilical connection between Purush and Prakriti. In the end, Shiva is shown as the ultimate being who sustains nature and creation. I believe that we will be able to connect with the central thought of COP 26 by using dance, storytelling and music to express the ancient Vedic lessons that are drawn from our mythology deeply,"" she said.

Humanity will not be saved by promises.""Draft decision texts urged countries to speed up their decarbonisation plans and submit renewed contributions by 2022, three years sooner than planned.They also included a rare mention of fossil fuels - anathema to large hydrocarbon producers but a key ask of the European Union and other advanced economies.Host Britain says it wants COP26 to lead to commitments from countries to keep the 1.5C temperature cap goal of the Paris agreement within reach.However, current national emissions cutting plans, all told, would lead to 2.7C of heating.UN Secretary Antonio Guterres said Thursday that countries' climate plans were ""hollow"" without commitments to rapidly phase out fossil fuels.- US-China pact - Negotiations received a shot in the arm Wednesday when the United States and China - the two largest emitters - unveiled a joint climate action plan.Although it was light on detail, observers said the pact allayed concerns that frosty US-China relations entering into COP26 would derail the talks.But trust levels between rich polluters and developing nations are low after developed countries failed to stump up the $100 billion a year they promised by 2020.Finance more generally is holding up progress in Glasgow, with developing nations insisting on more money for adaptation that can help them brace for future climate shocks.Developed nations meanwhile favour a greater push on emissions reductions, something countries yet to fully electrify their grids - and largely blameless for emissions - feel is unfair.""We have made steps forward,"" European Commission vice president Frans Timmermans told AFP.""It's not enough to address the issue that we face, but we're having a completely different conversation now than we had only a couple of months ago. Adaptation has really gone up on our global agenda.""Countries already battered by climate disasters such as record-breaking drought and flooding are demanding they be compensated separately for ""loss and damage"".Organisers said the draft texts dedicated an ""unprecedented"" section to loss and damage, but vulnerable nations said it stopped far short of their expectations.Other issues likely to delay an agreement in Glasgow include a long-simmering dispute over the rules governing carbon markets, and common reporting timeframes.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Manila Bulletin.

Director Iola Ynyr, of the Ynys Blastig arts project, said she wanted to show the power of nature and how we can all take little steps to embrace our surroundings, cherish the nature around and reduce our carbon footprint.Ynys Blastig began as a creative commission by Gwynedd Council to reduce the use of plastic and promote wellbeing.Iola said inspiration for the story came during lockdown when she used to go for long cycle rides to lift her spirits and would travel past Llyn Nantlle in Snowdonia, stopping by the gate looking down the lake. The song in the film, Llyn Llawenydd, which means lake of happiness, is by Gwynedd band Papur Wal and the film is shot at the school and around Snowdonia.She said: ""I had the idea of creating a film that showed how we can sometimes feel like insignificant 'blots' in our world, not sure where we fit in and how embracing nature can make us feel whole again.""The blot also represents the carbon footprints created by the way people are living, not considering its effect on nature,"" adding she was ""so impressed"" by how open the children were to express themselves creatively.She said: ""I wanted to show the power of nature and how we can all take little steps to embrace our surroundings and ensure that we conserve and cherish the nature around us by reducing our carbon footprint.

42,How climate targets are set - and the alarming consequences to Earth of rising temperatures;:: COP26 is debating whether to aim for a 1.5C or 2C cut - the result of which could save the planet,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Irish Independent,News,1025,"NEWS;Pg. 16,17",1025,Ireland,Adam Taylor ; Harry Stevens,,,,How climate targets are set - and the alarming consequences to Earth of rising temperatures:: COP26 is debating whether to aim for a 1.5C or 2C cut - the result of which could save the planet,"HOW much warming can the world bear?That question is one of the fundamental issues in dispute at the ongoing UN climate change summit, known as COP26, in Glasgow.Six years ago, when countries came together in Paris for the COP21 summit, at which the Paris climate accord was shaped, they committed to limit the global average temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. However, while the 2015 agreement set 2C as the minimum, it included language that suggested countries should push for a more ambitious goal: 1.5C.A preliminary draft of the COP26 agreement released on Wednesday ""reaffirms"" the Paris agreement's goal: limiting warming to well below 2C and pursuing a target of 1.5C. But it does not commit to meeting the 1.5C threshold.The difference between the two targets may seem small, but they represent divergent outcomes for the planet.Some experts doubt that 1.5C remains achievable. Evidence shows that the two targets also represent different scenarios for the climate's impact on human life. A study released on Tuesday by the UK Met Office, Britain's national weather service, found that one billion people could face heat stress, a potentially fatal combination of heat and humidity, if temperatures rise by 2C.""The higher the level of warming, the more severe and widespread the risks to people's lives, but it is still possible to avoid these higher risks if we act now,"" said Richard Betts, one of the leaders of the project.How did the world agree upon a 2C target? When world leaders came together in Paris in 2015, they were looking to reverse a long period of international inaction after the widely perceived failures of the 1992 Kyoto Protocol and the 2009 Copenhagen Accord.The latter had included non-binding language that referenced ""the scientific view that the increase in global temperature should be below 2 degrees Celsius"".Nearly 200 countries signed onto the agreement in Paris, which was adopted in 2015 and took effect in 2016. Under the accord, countries would set their own emission reduction targets and plans to reach those targets, but agreed to the long-term temperature goal to limit ""the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels"".Countries would also pursue ""efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, recognising that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change,"" according to the text.The two targets, one firm and one aspirational, represented a fierce policy debate. Developing countries had been pushing to set a rise of 1.5C as a target for years. Small island nations were often the most vocal in their support, pointing to the existential threat they faced.Around the world, many adopted the slogan ""1.5 to stay alive"".Has there been a movement toward a 1.5C target?The Paris agreement represented a significant shift. More than 100 countries expressed support for a target of 1.5C, including for the first time some major emitters. Notably, the United States got on board, joining a group called the High Ambition Coalition founded by the Marshall Islands in 2014.Scientific pressure played a role in the change. In a paper published during COP21, Nature Geoscience stated that ""no scientific assessment has clearly justified or defended the 2C target as a safe level of warming, and indeed, this is not a problem that science alone can address"".But there remained some scepticism, with oil and gas-producing Saudi Arabia among the countries pushing back on the more ambitious targets. Some officials argued that countries should keep to the less ambitious target so that countries were not set up for failure.President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris agreement and promoted the use of fossil fuels. Under President Joe Biden the United States has not only rejoined that agreement but also the group of nations that say that 1.5C should be the standard. What does the science say about the difference between 1.5C and 2C warming? The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a UN body responsible for assessing the scientific research on climate change, has warned that even an increase of 1.5C of global warming would result in significant differences, with increased heatwaves and short cold seasons.At 2C, however, the changes will be more profound. ""With every additional increment of global warming, changes in extremes continue to become larger,"" the IPCC wrote in a report released earlier this year that evaluated more than 14,000 papers. The IPCC has found that an extreme heat event that would have occurred once per decade in a climate without human influence would happen 4.1 times a decade at 1.5C of warming. It would occur 5.6 times at 2C.Other events such as heavy precipitation or drought would also increase.The IPCC also noted that it was very likely that the relative sea level will continue to rise throughout the 21st century and beyond, and the level it rises will be affected significantly by the level of climate change.If temperatures are confined to an increase of 1.5C, over the next 2,000 years, sea levels could rise by as much as 10 feet.But it could be double that if temperatures grow by 2C, the IPCC research found, and potentially worse if ice sheets in Antarctica become even more destabilised.What are we at now? A Washington Post analysis of multiple data sets has found that Earth has already warmed more than 1C on average over the past century. Some places may already have seen rises of 2C.In their latest report, the IPCC estimated that under the current scenario, the world would be likely to hit the 1.5C threshold by 2040.Under the most optimistic scenario presented in the report, global temperatures would reach 1.5C by the middle of the century and then drop back down as emissions were cut further, potentially averting some of the worst outcomes.But under the worst scenario envisaged by the IPCC, the best estimate was that the world will probably see a rise of 4.4C by the end of the century - with an extremely detrimental impact for life on Earth.

United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland",By Peter Davidson,,,,Nicola Sturgeon urges Boris Johnson to return to COP26 after draft agreement waters down push to curb fossil fuels,"A new draft of the deal that could be agreed at theCOP26climate conference inGlasgowtalks appears to have watered down its push to curb fossil fuels.The firstdraftof the ""cover decision"" for the overarching agreement at the summit called for countries ""to accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels"".In a new draft produced earlier today, that has changed to calling on countries to accelerate the shift to clean energy systems, ""including by rapidly scaling up clean power generation and accelerating the phaseout of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels"".The inclusion of a reference to fossil fuels was a first for a UN decision document of this type but was expected to get fierce pushback from some countries - and still may not survive to the final text.COP26 in Glasgow LIVE as new draft agreement waters down push to curb fossil fuelsNicola Sturgeon hits back after being criticised over number of COP26 selfiesTalks went on through the night and look set to overrun from their finish time of Friday evening as negotiators come under pressure to resolve issues around finance for poor countries, fossil fuels, the efforts of countries to cut emissions in the 2020s and rules on carbon markets and transparency.The latest draft appears to have strengthened language on getting countries to ""revisit and strengthen the2030targets"" in their national action plans by the end of 2022 to align with global goals to limit temperature rises to ""well below"" 2C and try to limit them to 1.5C.The new version ""requests"" countries do so, thought to be stronger language within theUNsystem than the previous version, which only urged them to do so.There is now a date - missing from the first draft - for when developed countries should double the provision of finance to help developing countries adapt to climate change - by 2025.Scottish politicsFollowing the publication of the agreement First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called on Boris Johnson to return to COP26 to get a deal over the line.She told BBC Breakfast: ""My message to the Prime Minister is come back here. Use your position as president of this Cop to really drive progress and push people as far as we can get them.""Because every inch forward that this text takes is of course another inch towards getting the world on to a path where we avoid climate catastrophe, and nothing, literally nothing, is more important than that.""""The reason I'm singling out Boris Johnson is not just because we're in the UK - well, it is actually because we're in the UK, because the UK is the Cop presidency, and that puts a particular onus on the shoulders of the UK Government.""Sturgeon said the deal is ""slightly better"" but it ""still has a way to go"".She said: ""So, it is in many respects slightly better than the draft that was published earlier in the week, but it still has a way to go.""So, on the upside, you know, there's a clear recognition that 1.5 degrees is the goal in terms of limiting global warming.

47,Time running out at COP26 summit to resolve 'critical issues',"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Globe and Mail (Canada),News,1063,"NEWS;Pg. A1,a4",1063,Canada,"PAUL WALDIE, ADAM RADWANSKI",,EUROPEAN UNION,EUROPEAN UNION,Time running out at COP26 summit to resolve 'critical issues',"LeadThe COP26 climate summit is entering its final scheduled day with an agreement to cut carbon emissions still a ways off and delegates stuck on several major issues, including whether to phase out coal and fossil-fuel subsidies, and how a carbon trading market would work.""We are not there yet on the most critical issues,"" COP26 president Alok Sharma said Thursday.Texte/TextHe has set a deadline of 6 p.m. local time Friday, but acknowledged that negotiations could run into the weekend.Delegates from nearly 200 countries are trying to cobble together a pact that will commit all nations to measures that will hold global warming to 1.5 C above preindustrial levels, a temperature level that scientists say would limit the devastation caused by climate change.Current national plans fall far short of that target and British officials have made ""keeping 1.5 C alive"" this conference's mantra.While some progress has been made, Mr. Sharma said several key issues remained unresolved.Among them is a proposed pledge to ""accelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels."" That commitment has never been stated in a United Nations climate agreement before and several countries, notably Australia and Saudi Arabia, are believed to be firmly against including it.However, environmental campaigners have argued that concrete action on coal and fossil fuels must be a priority, and they say even the proposed commitment is weak.The European Union's climate policy chief, Frans Timmermans, has strongly backed the proposal.That language ""has to be part of the conclusion here today,"" Mr. Timmermans told reporters in Glasgow on Thursday. ""Removing it would be an extremely, extremely bad signal.""Another critical issue is whether wealthy countries should provide financial support to developing nations to help them cope with damage they've already sustained from global warming.Known as ""loss and damage,"" this issue has been highly contentious for years and has never been included in a final text.The draft agreement includes a section that acknowledges the ""loss and damage"" issue and ""reiterates the urgency of scaling up action and support, including finance, technology transfer and capacity-building."" Leaders from several developing countries and climate justice advocates argue that doesn't go far enough and have called for the creation of a special fund to cover loss and damage costs.That would be in addition to the US$100-billion annually that developed countries are supposed to contribute to help poor countries take action to mitigate climate change and adapt their infrastructure to be more resilient to its effects.There is also pressure to lay the groundwork for significantly increasing that form of funding in future years.Meanwhile, there is some sense of optimism about agreement finally being reached on regulations for international carbon-trading markets, which is the most complex form of negotiating happening around the final deal.Article 6 of the 2015 Paris Agreement, which is supposed to allow countries that exceed their national emissions-reduction targets to sell credits to those struggling to meet theirs, has not yet come into effect because of disagreements over several of its key components.A common sense among those familiar with the talks is that, after attempts to resolve those differences at several previous editions of the annual conference fell short, most countries are eager to get a deal done this time to avoid the embarrassment of another failure amid the summit's general sense of urgency.Nevertheless, as of Thursday, some of those disagreements lingered.The most challenging of them is around how to ensure there is no double-counting, in which both countries in a credits sale wind up claiming the emissions reductions toward their targets.That issue is bogged down in extremely technical debates involving how to ensure fair accounting despite different countries setting their emissions targets in different ways.Some countries continue to advocate for language around the accounting mechanisms that others worry would overly complicate the process and could lead to a net loss of total emissions reductions.A second sticking point is around whether a small share of each transaction under the trading system should be levied into a fund for climate adaptation. It's strongly advocated by developing countries, but richer ones - including Canada - are wary, arguing that it could be disincentive for any trades to be made at all.Yet another long-standing debate around Article 6, but one that appears closer to resolution, is around what to do with credits created under an abandoned past attempt at an international carbon-trading market.Countries that hold those credits, most notably Brazil, have argued they should be allowed to use them in the new system; others have contended that the credits were created too easily and would undermine the system's credibility.But the two sides appear to be inching closer to a compromise, likely involving some of the preexisting credits being eligible for a time-limited period.There is also continuing discussion about Article 6's incorporation of human-rights safeguards, with Canada among other countries pushing for protections for Indigenous and other communities that could be adversely affected by projects used to generate credits.If negotiators are able to steer through all those issues, the hope is that the credit system will ultimately lead to greater collective emissions reduction than would otherwise be the case.It would be somewhat easier for countries to set ambitious targets given the additional means of meeting them, while those besting their targets would have incentive to raise their ambition further.Not everyone at COP26, however, is convinced that a deal on Article 6 would necessarily be a victory in itself, if standards around matters such as double counting or human rights are softened in the process.""Is accomplishing something just for the sake of accomplishing something really a win?"" questioned Erika Lennon, a senior lawyer with the Center for International Environmental Law, who is monitoring the Article 6 talks.""I definitely have concerns that in the push to make it look like there's a win, parties will wind up ultimately compromising on things that undermine the integrity of the Paris Agreement,"" Ms. Lennon said.",Copyright 2021 All material copyright The Globe and Mail or its licensors.

She'd spoken about the damaging effects of climate change on her homeland of Uganda and across Africa. As she scrolled through her phone a few hours later, she came across a news story about the press conference, and her heart sank.Texte/TextAn Associated Press photograph accompanying the article showed Ms. Thunberg and three of the other activists, all white Europeans. Ms. Nakate had been in the shot as well - part of her coat was barely visible in the photograph - but she'd been cropped out of the frame.""It was like the hardest thing because everyone's message was being talked about and my message was left out,"" she said in a tearful video posted later that day on Twitter. ""Does that mean I have no value as an activist or the people from Africa don't have any value at all?""The news agency later apologized and released the full photograph, but the episode sparked a worldwide outcry and it transformed Ms. Nakate into a climate-crusading superstar who now rivals Ms. Thunberg for global attention.Since the Davos debacle, Ms. Nakate, 24, has been invited to speak at conferences around the world and she's launched the Rise Up Movement to encourage climate activism in Africa. She's also been interviewed by actress Angelina Jolie, made the cover of Time magazine, and written a bestselling book appropriately titled, A Bigger Picture: My Fight To Bring A New African Voice To The Climate Crisis.""Being cropped out of the photo changed the course of my activism and my life,"" she wrote in the opening chapter. ""It reframed my thoughts about race, gender, equality and climate justice.""On Thursday, Ms. Nakate shared the stage at the COP26 climate summit with Antonio Guterres, the Secretary-General of the United Nations. With a steady voice and a slight accent, she delivered a passionate plea that drew sustained applause.""We see business leaders and investors flying into COP on private jets. We see them making fancy speeches. We hear about new pledges and promises,"" she told the delegates. ""I have come here to tell you that we don't believe you.""And in a direct pitch to business leaders she added: ""Show us your faithfulness, show us your trustworthiness, show us your honesty. I am here to say, prove us wrong.""Ms. Nakate has been a forceful voice throughout the summit both inside the conference centre and on the streets of Glasgow. While Ms. Thunberg was given no role at COP26, Ms. Nakate has participated in two panel discussions including one with actor Idris Elba. She's also been at the forefront of a pair of massive protest marches through the city's streets and she's headlined two rallies.It's a far cry from her youth in Kampala where Ms. Nakate was a shy, bookish child who went on to earn a business degree at Makerere University. As a college student she'd been interested in environmental issues and worried about the prolonged droughts and searing heat waves that had hit much of the continent. But she never dreamed of taking a public stand on the issue.That changed in 2018 when she saw news reports about Ms. Thunberg's climate strike in front of the Swedish parliament. In her book, Ms. Nakate said she was impressed by the Swede's commitment and she decided to hold a similar strike in downtown Kampala - a nerve-racking experience in a society that has strict norms about what women should and shouldn't do. She uploaded some pictures of her sit-in on Twitter, which Ms. Thunberg quickly retweeted. The photos went viral and Ms. Nakate soon found herself part of Ms. Thunberg's growing movement called Fridays for Future.She remains one of the few young climate activists from Africa and has a passion that world leaders find hard to ignore. Despite her prominence, the same problem she encountered in Davos surfaced again in Glasgow.When Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon met Ms. Thunberg and Ms. Nakate at the start of the summit, some news photographs of the meeting cut out Ms. Nakate and only showed Ms. Sturgeon and Ms. Thunberg. That drew a sharp rebuke from Ms. Thunberg who tweeted, ""Media needs to stop erasing the voices of activists.""Once again, more apologies and clarifications ensued.For teenagers such as Anna Brown, Ms. Nakate is an inspiration. ""Vanessa is an amazing person,"" said Ms. Brown, 19, who belongs to Fridays for Future in Glasgow. ""Everyone who hears her speak can really feel what she's saying. And I think a lot of the time she's very much a wake-up call for people.""Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day's most important headlines.

52,COP26 countries struggle to find compromise on funding;:: 'We still have a monumental challenge ahead of us',"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Irish Independent,News,551,NEWS;Pg. 17,551,Ireland,Caroline O'Doherty,,,,COP26 countries struggle to find compromise on funding:: 'We still have a monumental challenge ahead of us',"THE COP26 climate talks enter their final day with vulnerable countries determined not to let negotiations close without agreement on substantial funding from rich nations.Disagreements over finance stalled progress yesterday, with the attitude of the US and Europe both coming in for criticism from the global south.Among the issues in dispute were the fulfilment of a decade-old pledge to guarantee a high level of annual adaptation funding to help countries climate-proof their economies and infrastructure.The fund moved closer to the $100bn-a-year target during these talks, but the text of a draft agreement calls for that to be scaled up urgently.Disagreement over separate funding for 'loss and damage', which would provide emergency relief and rebuilding funds after climate-related disasters, was more entrenched.Dr Saleelmul Huq of the Bangladesh delegation said rich countries would have to be ""shamed"" into accepting their responsibilities for building their economies on fossil fuels now putting developing nations in peril.""Germany lost 200 people and suffered (EURO)30bn loss and damage from a small flood,"" Mr Huq said, referring to last July's disaster.""In Bangladesh we have 10 times bigger floods but nothing to pay for loss and damage. In Europe they are paying for their own citizens but not for ours.""Minister for Climate Action Eamon Ryan agreed the loss and damage issue was causing difficulties. However, he said Ireland's position was that while loss and damage should be funded, a separate funding structure would involve unnecessary replication of bureaucracy.He said some ideas in circulation in the negotiations around how funding could be provided included giving poor countries access to 'special drawing rights' from the International Monetary Fund so they did not have to resort to expensive borrowing.Multiple strands of negotiations were continuing last night, with more fresh draft agreement texts due before a meeting of ministers from all nations at 11am this morning.Aside from finance, the inclusion of a commitment to enhanced efforts on mitigation - cutting emissions to stem global temperature rise - was also causing tensions.It emerged that at one point, a group of 22 nations who are part of the Like-Minded Developing Countries group, which includes China and India, proposed deleting the entire section on mitigation in protest that developing countries were being asked to make the same percentage emissions cuts as rich nations.Talks president Alok Sharma said in his last press conference of the day: ""We still have a monumental challenge ahead of us.""Another sticking point was the proposed commitment to phase out fossil fuels and fossil fuel subsidies.Large oil, gas and coal producing countries want to keep supplying the fuels while attempting to offset emissions with technology or natural solutions.Mr Ryan, who earlier in the day signed Ireland up to become a founding member of the new Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, said the phaseout text needed to stay in.""I think it's vital that we do keep that language in,"" he said. ""How can we be subsidising something that's edging us closer to the abyss?""That language has to remain strong.""Demonstrations led by the Fridays for Future school strikers are planned for outside the COP26 venue this morning.",Copyright 2021 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved,,Newspaper|IIN|ENGLISH|National Edition|AGREEMENTSDEVELOPING COUNTRIESEMISSIONSDISASTER RELIEFNEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSTALKS & MEETINGSEMERGING MARKETSGLOBAL WARMINGPRESS CONFERENCESINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUNDINTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONSRELIEF ORGANIZATIONS|ENERGY & UTILITIESEMISSIONSGLOBAL WARMINGINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND|BANGLADESHEUROPEIRELANDCHINAGERMANYINDIAUNITED STATES,
53,"COP26 draft agreement waters down language on coal use and fossil fuel subsidies;As climate summit nears an end, critics urge delegates to strengthen pledges to transition toward low-emission energy systems","November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Breaking News from globeandmail.com,News,636,,636,Canada,Paul Waldie,,GREENPEACE INTERNATIONAL,GREENPEACE INTERNATIONAL,"COP26 draft agreement waters down language on coal use and fossil fuel subsidiesAs climate summit nears an end, critics urge delegates to strengthen pledges to transition toward low-emission energy systems","LeadDelegates to the COP26 climate summit have revised a draft agreement to cut carbon emissions and watered down a pledge to phase out coal and subsidies for fossil fuels.The new draft was released Friday morning and delegates will now debate further modifications. The conference is supposed to end at 6 p.m. local time on Friday but talks are expected to extend into the weekend.Texte/TextAn early draft of the deal proposed by the host country Britain on Thursday called for nations to ""accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels."" The new version says countries should accelerate the transition toward low-emission energy systems and phase out ""unabated coal power"" and ""inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels.""Specific mention of coal and fossil fuels has never been part of a COP agreement and British officials had conceded that the language was likely to face opposition from countries such as Australia and Saudi Arabia. However, officials will view even the milder language as something of a victory.But Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, said the text was far too weak. ""Right now, the fingerprints of fossil fuel interests are still on the text and this is not the breakthrough deal that people hoped for in Glasgow,"" she said Friday. ""The key line on phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies has been critically weakened, but it's still there and needs to be strengthened again before this summit closes.""Ms. Morgan also noted that the next text also went from ""urging"" countries to strengthen their 2030 emissions targets to merely ""requesting"" they do so by 2022.Bob Ward, of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change at the London School of Economics, said the section on coal and fossil fuel was still significant. ""The call for countries to phase out unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies is very important and historic,"" he said. ""Unabated coal power releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and all subsidies for fossil fuels are inefficient.""Analysts said the new draft agreement also strengthened the section relating to financial support for developing nations to help them meet climate goals. That includes measures to deal with so called ""loss and damage,"" which involves reparation for the harm global warming has already had on many developing countries.Reparations for climate change have been a controversial topic for years at United Nations summits and developed countries have generally resisted including mention of the issue in final COP agreements. However, developing nations have been ratcheting up pressure at COP26 to go further on the issue and to set up a loss and damage fund to cover the costs of climate change.The new draft didn't mention a new fund but it did add more wording on establishing technical procedures ""for the implementation of relevant approaches to avert, minimize, and address loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change in developing countries.""""That's the start of a breakthrough in the demands of vulnerable countries,"" said Yamide Dagnet, director of climate negotiations at the World Resources Institute.The new text also noted ""with deep regret"" that wealthy countries had yet to meet a target set in 2009 to provide US$100-billion to help developing nations take action to mitigate climate change. The goal was supposed to have been met by 2020 but it now appears unlikely to be reached until 2023. The new draft goes further than the initial draft and urges rich countries to ""significantly increase support for developing country parties, beyond US$100-billion per year.""Our Morning Update and Evening Update newsletters are written by Globe editors, giving you a concise summary of the day's most important headlines.

55,COP26: Major polluting countries face legal action from small island states over rising sea levels – Simona Marinescu,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Scotsman,News,610,COLUMNISTSPOLITICSENVIRONMENTWORLDCLIMATE CHANGEGLASGOW AND STRATHCLYDE,610,Scotland,Simona Marinescu,,,,COP26: Major polluting countries face legal action from small island states over rising sea levels – Simona Marinescu,"The resolution encourages states to adopt policies and partner with civil society and businesses to protect the environment as a public good.The council’s bold move was received with much hope by environmental and human rights activists worldwide.The Scotia Group, a global network of prominent internationalists which I am a proud member of, has similarly called for a new social contract to integrate the right to a healthy environment.While this sounds promising, its enforcement requires a strong commitment to decarbonisation by all governments; its completion by the middle of this century is critical for many of the small island states I work with as a UN coordinator in Samoa.Among the 43 UN member states that adopted this important resolution, two are ‘small island developing states’ (known as “SIDS”), Cuba and Marshall Islands.Other island states who signed included Kiribati, the Maldives and Tuvalu. Should progress towards net-zero by mid-century fail, large parts of these countries will no longer exist.READ MORE: COP26 climate change summit: Here's what each degree of global warming would mean for the planet – Mark LynasIn the case of small island states, guaranteeing access to a safe and healthy environment cannot be the responsibility of national governments alone. Responsible for less than one per cent of global emissions, small island states are not accountable for the harm that climate change inflicts on their people and economies.Countries like Kiribati and Samoa will never be able to stop the loss of biodiversity and the increasing human insecurity on their own if global warming caused by the big emitters continues unabated.To recover from the devastating economic impact of Covid-19, last week the 58 members of the Alliance of Small Island States made some key asks of the G20 nations.They asked for easier access to development finance as well as being given the chance to defer some of the huge debt payments which are currently hampering their chances of making a domestic economic recovery.Sadly, these requests appear to have been ignored, and the G20 came out with no specific solutions to help small island states out of their current dire predicament.As Professor Sir Anton Muscatelli said recently this newspaper, decarbonising the planet is “the most radical economic transformation we have made in peacetime”.While this week’s UN Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero is great news, SIDS will not qualify for access to such resources under the current rules.Unwilling to wait anymore, in the last few days Antigua, Barbuda and Tuvalu have signed an accord seeking justice before international courts for climate-induced damage.Other states are expected to join the Commission of Small Island States on Climate Change and International Law to request assistance from the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea on the legal responsibilities of major polluting states for carbon emissions, marine pollution, and rising sea levels.Climate-forced displacement is not an adaptation measure, but rather a profoundly distressing reality for the 65 million people living on Small Island Developing States.Only a firm, binding consensus in Glasgow over how we can achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 can help avert a climate tragedy for them.Simona Marinescu is UN resident coordinator for SamoaA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this article.

56,COP26: Promises galore and a game of lobbies,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Northlines (India),News,1230,,1230,"India, Republic of",,,,,COP26: Promises galore and a game of lobbies,"Jammu, Nov. 12 -- India never reneges on such commitments but there are various lobbies that are on reckless construction in sensitive zones leading to serious crisisThe COP26 climate meet is full of promises as the desertification threat to India and the world increases. The meet is less on concrete terms to bring down temperature but high on verbosity.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has struck the right chord. He has taken time till 2070 so that India's development is not smothered by the reticence of the developed world. He says that the commitment to climate has a cost and the rich nations are not meeting out their pledge of providing $100 billion a year to developing nations by 2020 as agreed at the climate conference in Copenhagen in 2009. The target has not yet been met.The commitment is significant to climate financing negotiations and the steps by rich countries, which till now have not met their pledge of providing $100 billion a year.Nations like Saudi Arabia, Japan and Australia on the other hand are asking the UN to play down the need to move away from fossil fuels. The Inter-Governmental panel on Climate Change says that 32,000 submissions have been made by governments, companies and other interested parties to dilute the issues of fossil fuel.They are arguing that that the world does not need to reduce the use of fossil fuels as quickly as the current draft of the report recommends. A West Asian country's oil ministry has sought removal of phrases like the need for urgent and accelerated mitigation actions at all scales. The issue of temperature reduction by 2 degrees may remain on paper as they press for slower action and temperature limit be reduced to 1.5 degrees.Australia does not accept the conclusion that closing coal-fired thermal power plants is necessary, even though the CoP26 objective is to end the use of coal that adds to the problem of greenhouse effect. OPEC also asks the IPCC to delete lobby activism, protecting rent extracting business models. Saudi Arabia wants deletion of the UN conclusion that the focus of decarbonisation efforts in the energy sector needs to move rapidly shifting to zero-carbon sources and actively phasing out fossil fuels.Many developing countries are not comfortable with the zero emission. Argentina, Norway and OPEC also challenge the contention. Norway argues the UN scientists should allow the possibility of capture and storage (CCS) as a potential tool for reducing emissions from fossil fuels. Even India had to resort to larger coal prospecting as its power system was reportedly coming to a critical stage and it had to keep the thermal power plants running.The draft report accepts carbon could play a role in the future but says there are uncertainties about its feasibility. The CCS emerges as a vague term for continuing with the fossil fuel.In 2015, the Paris Agreement stressed the need for limiting temperature between 2 degrees to 1.5 degree Celsius before 2100. India's and China's commitment has increased hopes that zero emission is possible by 2070 but that again does not remain a certainty.The globe is warming up faster. The climate change is to affect rainfall patterns and warmer atmosphere can lead to more rainfall in some areas and drought in many others. It is expected to increase global poverty as water in excess or shortage would play havoc with human development.The global area of dry lands is expected to expand as the climate warms. Various projections on emission scenarios indicate arid lands will increase by 11 to 23 percent compared a 30-year period of 1961 to 1990. This means that dry lands could be 50 to 56 percent of the earth's land surface, a 38 percent rise, by 2021. The arid regions will expand over southwest of North America, north and south Africa and Australia, the Mediterranean and South America.Now at Glasgow CoP 26, Australia and 123 other countries signed an agreement to end deforestation by 2030. There have been many such declarations before. Such policies have to be adopted by different countries at the domestic level. If these are not implemented due to domestic political pressure such declarations would have little impact.India never reneges on such commitments but there are various lobbies that are on reckless constructions in the Himalayas and other sensitive zones leading to serious crisis. About 97.85 million hectares (29.7 percent) of India's total geographical area (TGA) of 328.72 mha underwent land degradation during 2018-19. In 2003-05, 94.53 mha (28.76 percent of the TGA) underwent land degradation. The number increased to 96.40 mha (29.32 percent of the TGA) in 2011-13.About 83.69 mha underwent desertification in 2018-19. This was greater than the 81.48 mha in 2003-2005 and 82.64 mha in 2011-13. India witnessed an increase in the level of desertification in 28 of 31 states and Union territories between 2011-13 and 2018-19.Forest covers are dwindling all over Asia and various Indian states too are amending their laws for increased ""developmental activities"" across. Tree felling and water erosion also is causing heavy erosion as construction activities are increasing. The Centre's commitment and the states' priorities often clash and the later play havoc at the ground level.A McGill paper has found that more airport constructions would create environmental problems, increase warming and other ecological issues. Since these have become symbols of fast development, across India, and in many other countries, more airports are being constructed. Each adds to degeneration. Recently in UP and the hilly states a number of airports are being constructed for ""better connectivity"".The IPCC says that various climate model simulations suggest that rainfall, when it does occur, will be more intense for almost the entire world, potentially increasing the risks of soil erosion. Projections indicate that most of the world will see a 16 to 24 percent increase in heavy precipitation intensity by 2100.So, desertification means that there is overall land degradation in water-scarce parts of the world. Since large business lobbies are engaged in such activities, it has become difficult for any government across the globe to stop them though it causes deterioration of the economic productivity of the land and its ability to farm the land for commercial or subsistence purposes. The degradation includes the decline in quality of soil, vegetation, water resources or wildlife. Each of it affects the quality of life and livelihood.Director of research at the Grantham Institute at Imperial College, London, Joeri Rogelji, says that various pledges at different climate meets are still not sufficient to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and CoP 26 still has an important task. The temperature control the pledges need to strengthen but, he says, the pledges do not match the ambitions.The International Energy Agency is unhappy with what the governments are trying to show they are doing. The governments need to have clear and credible policies. Ambitions count for little if they are not implemented successfully.(The writer is a senior journalist.

58,COP26: PUTTRU releases discussion paper on sustainable energy transition in Africa,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Business Day,News,520,,520,"Nigeria, Federal Republic of",,,,,COP26: PUTTRU releases discussion paper on sustainable energy transition in Africa," As the world intensifies the race towards net-zero emissions targets, Africa's foremost energy business facilitation platform, PUTTRU, has issued a Discussion Paper, targeting the ongoing COP26 Summit in Glasgow, Scotland. Titled, 'Africa's Sustainable Energy Transition: Assessing the True CostsReflections for COP26, the paper is currently available for free downloads at www.puttru.com and aims at stimulating robust discourse that would proffer feasible solutions to the issue of energy transition in Africa, considering the constraints and realities in the global energy system.uthored and reviewed by a team of energy experts, the paper is divided into four sections. Section One is the Introduction and presents the objectives of the paper. Section Two, defines and discusses the inherent constraints of energy systems, namely technical feasibility and stability of the grid, environmental concerns, security of energy supply, and energy costs.In Section Three, the paper presents the implications of these inherent constraints on Africa's evolving energy system, while Section Four offers recommendations and conditions for a decarbonised energy system pathway for the African continent.Former Managing Director of Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas, NLNG, Godswill Ihetu in the paper's foreword writes: ""The Discussion Paper is comprehensive and well-written. It captures elements of the tangible and intangible costs to Africa in joining the net zero emissions targets proposed mainly by the G20 and other wealthy countries.""To be sure, those who have been responsible for pollution must clean up, especially given the fact that the developed world has burned vast amounts of fossil fuels since the last one hundred years as it powered the industrial revolution that has led to its socioeconomic development.Read also:NLNG: 17 years after, more nods for Nigeria's creative sector""With Africa having largely been left out of this industrialisation process, the continent must insist on Climate Justice. Africa must be allowed to generate its own electricity with fossil fuels; hence the embargo on funding new fossil fuel development should apply to only the wealthy, developed countries. It should be noted, however, that certain Western countries have been discouraging foreign investors from investing in oil and gas assets in Africa, claiming that they might end up with stranded assets in the future. This mindset must be addressed robustly by African countries.""While I agree that Africa should not ignore renewables, the continent must not pursue development of alternative energy sources to the detriment of its fossil fuel assets. In any case, immediate cessation of fossil fuel usage is not possible for Africa at this point, as countries' needs differ in many ways. Therefore, adaptation and mitigation must be a continuous process, especially for Africa's vulnerable economies.""PUTTRU, founded by energy specialist, Monica Maduekwe is at the forefront of bridging energy gaps in Africa by leveraging technology which enables African energy businesses and financiers to connect within Africa and beyond.",Copyright 2021 Business Day All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|English US|EMISSIONSENERGY & UTILITY POLICYSUSTAINABILITYSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTCARBON NEUTRAL ENERGYEMERGING MARKETSENERGY & ENVIRONMENTENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICENEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSPOLLUTION & ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTSFOREIGN INVESTMENTNATURAL GAS PRICESNEGATIVE NEWSENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCES|ALTERNATIVE & RENEWABLE ENERGYEMISSIONSENERGY & UTILITY POLICYSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTIONENERGY & UTILITIESCARBON NEUTRAL ENERGYENERGY & ENVIRONMENTNATURAL GASNATURAL GAS PRODUCTSOIL & GAS INDUSTRYNATURAL GAS PRICESLIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|AFRICANIGERIASCOTLAND",
59,COP26 stokes optimism against climate change but global action must follow,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,China Daily (Hong Kong Edition),News,1072,,1072,"Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China
China, People's Republic of",Arvea Marieni,,,,COP26 stokes optimism against climate change but global action must follow,"It has become clear at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP 26, in Glasgow, Scotland, that the climate challenge is perceived as global. The challenge transcends politics, as was put by EU Commission Executive Vice President Frans Timmermans from Glasgow.The tone has changed, as noted by Youssef Nassef, director of the UN Adaptation Division of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, who said that in the history of the conferences, ""there has never been such a large number of voluntary initiatives"".The question is whether this consensus is also reflected in global determination to substantially reform the economic system. That is a different order of challenge that is nothing less than civilizational. As Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said right before COP 26, ""We are changing the economic system.""The focus rests on how to bring to the mainstream the innovation to accelerate the transition to a post-fossil fuel economy. The first step, however, is to build a new system of rules for the ecological industrial system. New policies must be designed to ensure the scalability of solutions and the transformation of markets. A whole-economy carbon (and resource) price is what we need. This will transform our societies and the way we all live.A key dimension of this failure is political. In the history of climate negotiations while environment ministers made commitments to reduce carbon emissions, their colleagues of energy, agriculture and finance promoted policies to support the production and consumption of fossil fuels. This contradiction has marked the entire long journey of the COPs, albeit in different ways over the year. The global environmental challenge of climate change requires policies both to reduce the carbon intensity of the economy as well as to enhance the natural carbon sinks: energy, industry, transport, agriculture, taxation/incentives, are the main sectoral policies to be involved in addressing climate change.To address environmental challenges, environmental management needs to shift towards social and industrial systems. Our society needs to use carbon less intensely, while we bolster the resilience of the environment by enhancing carbon sinks. The rules of the new economy are simple: to mainstream climate regulation, you need to internalize the external environmental damage. ""Cheap"" or ""expensive"" should be a calculation that involves extraction, production, and consumption. Once these externalities are integrated in the market system, energy producers and national economies will have a ""level playing field."" And this industrial, economic, and social revolution needs to happen quickly and globally. There is a sense of urgency. China's top climate negotiator Xie Zhenhua believes that a broad deal on carbon markets is becoming possible. German State Secretary for the Environment Jochen Flasbarth said, ""The new normal of COP26 is speeding things up"". Eventually, how we build forward better, will make or break the success of the ecological transition. Even more than before, truly ecological standards are needed.What we need is an orderly transition. If rich states are unwilling to assume a fair share of the cost, in their own interest, we will all fail. In Glasgow, some steps have been taken to show support. To date, Glasgow has dealt with everything from green infrastructure for poor countries to the end of coal in South Africa to the water crisis. According to Prime Minister Draghi, money is not the issue here. But the main task lies with private and green finance. New mechanisms are needed to address this demand. Today, even the US Congress is talking about a carbon price. And technical negotiations, which revolve around clauses of the Paris Agreement are moving on in Glasgow, with China playing an active role. As declared by EU Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans, the Chinese ""are ambitious on the transition to renewables"".Beijing has put a concrete program on the table, and it has already been converted into law. If internal and geopolitical conditions allow, it will be improved. The EU is banking on collaboration. Geopolitical tensions could undermine collaboration and the common fight to save the planet's climate. Relations among big powers are not at their best, which affects complex negotiations around how to ensure that emissions are reported transparently and correctly, and to ensure negotiators to finalize the so called ""Paris Rulebook"".That China and the United States find common grounds in Glasgow has great geopolitical significance. The US-China Joint Glasgow Declaration is a good omen for the planet and bodes well for a reinforced global climate governance. The two sides declare that they are ""committed to tackling (the urgent threat of accelerated climate change) through their respective accelerated actions in the critical decade of the 2020s.""For months, the world watches over the two largest economies seeking for a common position for COP26. The two countries' special envoys hoped to replicate the model for cooperation, created and tested by John Kerry and Xie Zhenhua themselves, which contributed to the success of Paris. Indeed, the breakthrough Declaration announces that ""the two sides intend to establish a ""Working Group on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s"".After the injection of optimism in Glasgow, it's time to move from words to deeds. The clock is ticking. China, which often under-promises and over-delivers, is moving towards an ecological civilization.Europe aims to become the world's first climate neutral continent. The EU moves a step forward by reaching a deal with the United States over their dispute on steel and aluminum, which links climate policy, problems related to overcapacity and dispute settlement under WTO rules. Joe Biden's USA has begun its journey to a zero-emissions economy.To paraphrase an Italian philosopher, ""the old world is dying, while the new struggles to be born."" It might have been the time of monsters. Since yesterday, we seem to be ready to fight them back.The author is a leading strategy, innovation and sustainability expert specializing in EU China environmental cooperation.

60,COP26: Why Scotland's puffins must be protected at all costs,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Scotsman,News,356,ENVIRONMENTWEATHERWORLDSCOTLAND,356,Scotland,Ginny Sandersonginny.sanderson@jpimedia.co.uk,,EASYJET PLC,EASYJET PLCAIRBUS SAS,COP26: Why Scotland's puffins must be protected at all costs,"A sea mist, also known as a haar, had descended as we approached the Firth of Forth island by speedboat. It gave an otherworldly atmosphere to the scene as the very first puffin emerged out of the opaque fog.READ MORE:COP26: Easyjet wants to be the first to fly passengers in hydrogen-powered Airbus aircraft from 2035 Flapping its little wings for dear life, its beak was stuffed with the sandeels it was carrying back to its nest on the island – some invisible calling guiding its way through the mist. Very quickly, more and more puffins appeared, and they were joined by shags, razorbills and gannets, all gliding in the same direction. The island emerged from the mists like something out of a dream, or Skull Island from King Kong.On every ledge, every possible available surface, were sea birds. It is a place completely overtaken by nature.In fact, when you get off the boat, you are almost immediately dive-bombed by furious arctic terns protecting their chicks. When you tour the island, you must stick to the paths as puffins nest in burrows underground – not easy to spot and easily trampled. Humans are guests here, permitted to respectfully observe the some 200,000 seabirds, including 90,000 puffins, which visit the Isle of May each year to breed and nest. I have never been anywhere on Earth so overwhelmingly beautiful and wild. You can perhaps understand then why I was so horrified to learn that puffins are among the species most threatened by climate change. The Worldwide Fund for Nature has singled them out in a list of 12 species from all over the world which are “feeling the heat” of global warming most keenly. A rise in ocean temperature is threatening the extinction of their most common prey, the sandeel. Climate change is also causing more drastic weather events at sea – where the puffins live most of their lives.

It has been a listening one too. And whatever its outcome, that, I hope, might be the biggest legacy of this conference and those like it.These last 10 days or so on the Clyde have offered a historic opportunity for many otherwise ignored or marginalised voices to be heard, if far from always heeded.We have seen - more outside the conference halls than in - calls for action on carbon emissions from those on the frontline of global heating, such as women from the developing world.But even inside the SEC, at the heart of COP26, this week there was a day-long discussion on gender and climate change, one of nine key topics raised during the summit. Nancy Pelosi, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Nicola Sturgeon attended but some critics scoffed at what they saw as a trendy distraction, as politically-correct box-ticking.

He’s making this a day trip to the most important summit ever on climate change. When he is a host that is a dereliction of duty. He should be staying to get a grip.”He was speaking in Glasgow as the Prime Minister arrived at the Clydeside conference to host a press conference and hold a series of bilateral meetings with other leaders.The former Labour leader highlighted how the draft agreement from the two weeks of talks issued on Wednesday would still leave a massive 28 billion tonne carbon gap on the emissions that should be stopped to prevent global temperatures rising.He said: “I think we do need to be clear that there is a chasm between where we are and where we need to be.“The last 24 hours have been a pretty devastating reality check on the government attempts to frankly greenwash Glasgow.”“Climate Action tracker tells us that rather than 1.5 degrees pledges for 2030 were are on track for a devastating 2.4 degrees which will mean billions of people suffering extreme heatwaves.”“We need to reduce emissions from our projected 53 billion tonnes in 2030 to 25 billion tonnes by that date. That’s a 28 billion tonne gap and on the UN update from yesterday we’ve closed just 4.8 billion tonnes of that 28 billion tonnes gap. That is a long, long way from where we need to be.”He added: “I think the message to world leaders from Boris Johnson should be very clear, which is no more fudges no more loopholes, no more get out of jail free cards.

This is why we have disarmed your car by deflating one or more of its tyres.'The campaigners, who are among thousands of protesters who have travelled to Glasgow over the past fortnight to take part in demonstrations, added on the flyer: 'Action is required from you: Go small. Go public transport.'Police Scotland said it had put on 'increased patrols in the area to provide reassurance to local residents' following the incidents. MailOnline has asked whether any arrests have been made and whether further action will be taken. Tyred of SUVs have 'strongly denied' damaging any tyres - which have to be pumped back up - and insisted that 'deflation via the valve is by far the quickest and easiest way to deflate a tyre, and leaves the tyre intact'.The group is made up of breakaway activists from Glasgow Calls Out Polluters (GCOP), a group of fossil fuel divestment campaigners who formed after the city was announced in August 2019 as the COP26 host location. GCOP have been involved in various protests over the past fortnight and joined with Extinction Rebellion on Monday to block a busy road by chaining themselves to bicycles in the city, leading to 16 arrests.Among the motorists affected by the protests was pharmacist Jamie MacConnacher, who discovered the two front tyres of his Land Rover had been deflated yesterday morning - along with several other cars in the local area.                     What to do if your vehicle tyre has been deflated                   Climate activists at 'Tyred of SUVs' say they deflated the tyres, and did not damage them. They insisted that 'deflation via the valve is by far the quickest and easiest way to deflate a tyre, and leaves the tyre intact'.But a flat tyre needs to be pumped up before driving away because this could otherwise damage the wheels.Halford recommends removing the cap and inserting an LED tyre pressure gauge into the valve, which displays pressure in PSI (pound force per square inch). You can then compare the measured PSI to the recommended PSI of your tyres. This can be established by checking the numbers on the sidewall of the tyre, to give its size.This can then be compared against the recommended pressures, which will be in the owner's manual and often on the inside of the driver's door sill or the fuel cap.You can then top up the pressure using a tyre inflator, by removing the value caps and press the hose fitting down on the valve. Then press the lever, or, if the hose has a screw fitting, screw until tight. Once the inflator is turned on, you should feel air flowing through the hose.The gauge will show when the correct pressure has been reached. You should then recheck the pressures with the digital gauge, and put the valve caps back on.He told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme: 'I don't think targeting individuals that have these vehicles is the right way to do it. They don't know what the reason for somebody having that car is.'I understand that there is a need for change, I'm totally for that. I would have an electric car but it's the logistics in the West End of Glasgow. There's nowhere to charge outside your flat so it just doesn't work for me.'Solicitor and mother Lucy Conn, 31, who lives in Glasgow's West End, said she found her tyres had been deflated after leaving her house at about 12.30pm yesterday to go on the nursery run.But she said her car was unfairly targeted because it is a two-wheel car with a 1.6 litre engine - and not an SUV.Ms Conn added that the tyres of her neighbour's car, which has a 1.2 litre engine, had also been deflated.She told The Scotsman: 'I thought it was a bit mean given there were two car seats in the back of the car - it's obviously not a car for one person. It is always normal folk that get the brunt of it'.Tyred of SUVs later apologised for this specific incident, telling the newspaper: 'Our intention was to target SUVs only. If Ms Conn's car was targeted by our group, we apologise.'The mistake may have been due to the fact that more and more non-SUVs are being designed to look like SUVs - apparently, climate destruction is fashionable.' Other motorists hit by the action took to social media to air their frustration, including Victoria Young who tweeted: 'To the idiots who did this to my car as I'm trying to get to Paisley High Court this morning.'Did it ever occur to you that the driver might have to use their vehicle in an emergency? It's being reported to Police Scotland.' One member of Tyred of SUVs, known only as Fin, told the BBC: 'We feel we need to do this because we need to point to the people who are responsible - rich people in the global north.'This is a minor inconvenience that is not going to disrupt them in a huge way. What is really going to disrupt people's lives and kill them is the climate crisis caused by rich people - basically SUV owners.'Tyred of SUVs said that no tyres were damaged in the action. A spokesman for the group said: 'If 4×4 drivers were a nation, they'd be the 7th biggest polluters on the planet (Source: International Energy Agency). 'If the 1 per cent won't take responsibility for the climate destruction they wreak, we'll make them.'A Police Scotland spokesman told MailOnline: 'We are aware of these incidents and there will be increased patrols in the area to provide reassurance to local residents.'",Copyright 2021 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

However, the small jets are generally more polluting than scheduled airliners. A change in aviation technology could soon change that","Few came by train, like climate activists Greta Thunberg or Luisa Neubauer. Most of the 25,000 or so participants travelled to the UN Climate Change Conference COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, by plane. The ""Rail to the Cop"" campaign, with which environmentalists pleaded for a rail journey at least for participants from Europe, and a specially deployed Eurostar train, met with little response.Even when it came to air travel, many participants did not rely on scheduled flights. Instead, around 400 private jets and numerous government aircraft were counted with the delegations from all over the world. For aircraft enthusiasts at the fence of the three airports Glasgow, Edinburgh and Prestwick a celebration. But for environmentalists, climate hypocrisy and ""a nadir of carbon inequality "". As well as arriving and departing, planes flew longer distances for parking, some empty.Japan reportedly sent an empty large Boeing 777-300 from Tokyo to Scotland in advance for training purposes. The crew of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had to circle over Glasgow in an Airbus 321 for about 20 minutes because the many private jets blocked a landing. British media calculated that the 400 private jets used by politicians, VIPs and corporate executives alone emitted 13,000 tonnes of CO₂ into the atmosphere. That would be more than 1600 Scots caused per year. The private jets in particular are criticised by climate protectionists. They see the smaller planes as relatively bigger air polluters than the large models from Airbus or Boeing.Transport and Environment (T&E), the umbrella organization of non-governmental European organizations from the sustainable transport sector, published a study on this in the spring. According to this study, CO₂ emissions from private jets in Europe rose by almost a third (31 percent) between 2005 and 2019 - and thus significantly faster than in commercial air transport, i.e. Lufthansa & Co.In just one hour, a single private jet could emit two tonnes of CO₂, while arithmetically one person in the EU contributes around 8.2 tonnes over the course of a year. The study states that ""just one percent of the world's population accounts for 50 percent of global aviation emissions."" The report concludes that private jets pollute the environment five to 14 times more than commercial planes (per passenger) and 50 times more than trains. The gap is set to widen, it said, as private jet users take advantage of ever-larger models.But criticism of small plane users could turn to praise in a few years if technology changes. One of the features of private jets is that the aircraft models with room for a dozen or two passengers could become the pioneers of zero-emission flying. Private jet owners, who have an average fortune of €1.3 billion, according to the T&E study, could help develop greener technologies and accelerate innovation.Andrew Murphy, director of aviation at T&E, claims, ""Flying on a private jet is probably the most polluting thing you can do"" Super-rich people would travel as polluters, as if there were no climate crisis. But Murphy sees an opportunity for the private jet market to be ideally suited to ""give aviation its own Tesla moment, helping hydrogen and electric aircraft to take off.""As such, there are several projects underway around the world for greener aircraft. The first smaller e-powered models are already flying, and Airbus hopes to launch a zero-emissions model by 2035. Experts agree that it will take considerably longer for large long-haul aircraft. Eco-fuels (sustainable fuels) could already contribute to CO₂ reduction. Depending on the production method, this involves the use of plants/biomass, food waste, waste oil or, in new processes, the conversion of carbon dioxide, electricity and water into synthetic fuel. However, eco-fuel, which is itself produced without emissions from green electricity, is only available in homeopathic doses.The appeasement now also mentioned at the COP26 summit in Glasgow to the address of climate protectionists, that eco-fuel has been filled or blended in some models, could have been an eco fig leaf. What matters is how the fuel was produced. The federal government has repeatedly pointed out in the past that it offsets all air travel by members of the government with CO₂ allowances.Disclaimer: Translation automatically generated.

Andrew Kennedy from EAC provided an overview of the council's climate change strategy, including the £24.5 million Community Renewable Energy project (CoRE) in Cumnock.He was then given a tour of the low carbon building, including the facility's 15,500 square foot trading floor, where scale-ups, SMEs and newcos will create employment through digital and cyber technologies built around health, energy and enterprise.The HALO Enterprise and Innovation Centre, which is due to open its doors in January 2022, has just released a range of packages designed to support these innovative, growing businesses.The HALO Enterprise and Innovation Centre is powered by 150 rooftop solar panels and by 100 per cent renewable power supplied by its partner, ScottishPower. Mr Katsavoy also saw up close some of the development's other low carbon innovations including its battery power storage, electric bike and car recharging stations and the HALO's bespoke electric bus.Ayrshire thug said he'd rape cops and their kids after threatening to stab social workerCommenting on his visit, Yoav Katsavoy, chairman of Israel Electricity Authority, said: ""This was a very inspiring and interesting visit.""This is a timely reminder that we need to bear in mind the needs of the local communities as we tackle the big challenge of our journey to net zero emissions.""Ayr mum of nine-week old twins alarmed after gas engineers discover 'corroding' pipesMarie Macklin said: ""I'm proud that Mr Katsavoy and the Israel Electricity Authority have shown such a close interest in The HALO. As COP26 gets under way in Glasgow, we're keen to demonstrate the low carbon credentials of The HALO Enterprise and Innovation Centre.""We see this as a place to collaborate with the rest of the world. With the State of Israel's status as a world leader in developing cyber and digital skills, this was an excellent opportunity to demonstrate not just just how far advanced we are here in East Ayrshire in driving the sustainability agenda, but also this vital area for skills development in our young people and for our entrepreneurial businesses.""General In Your Area WidgetDon't miss the latest Ayrshire headlines -",Copyright 2021 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper; Web Publication|WEBDAR|ENGLISH|ENERGY & UTILITY LAWRENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRYELECTRIC MOBILITYSUSTAINABILITYSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTELECTRIC VEHICLE INDUSTRYELECTRIC VEHICLESEMISSIONSENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMSSOLAR POWER INDUSTRYENTREPRENEURSHIPTECHNICIANS & TECHNOLOGICAL WORKERSPETROLEUM ENGINEERINGURBAN DEVELOPMENT|ALTERNATIVE & RENEWABLE ENERGYELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRYENERGY & UTILITIESENERGY & UTILITY LAWRENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRYELECTRIC MOBILITYSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTELECTRIC VEHICLE INDUSTRYELECTRIC POWER PLANTSELECTRIC VEHICLESEMISSIONSENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMSSOLAR POWER INDUSTRYPETROLEUM ENGINEERING|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|ISRAEL",

Yet the new version has inserted the word ""inefficient"" next to the word ""subsidies"".It now calls on countries to accelerate the shift to clean energy systems, ""including by rapidly scaling up clean power generation and accelerating the phaseout of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels"".The inclusion of a reference to fossil fuels was a first for a UN decision document of this type, but was expected to get fierce pushback from some countries.It comes after UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres warned the goal of keeping 1.5C within reach was ""on life support"".In an interview with AP, Mr Guterres said: ""The worst thing would be to reach an agreement at all costs by a minimum common denominator that would not respond to the huge challenges we face.""It is the moment to reach agreement by increasing ambition in all areas: mitigation, adaptation and finance, in a balanced way,"" he said.Experts and campaigners were trawling through the new agreement this morning.Economist Lord Stern told the BBC: ""It falls short of what one would hope for in the sense of really driving to 1.5C and tackling clean development.""But actually I think it goes beyond where I thought it might be a few days ago when we saw the one before.""I think this new text is stronger, a greater sense of urgency, looking at all forms of finance and the importance of getting it in place next year.""

The US and China said on Wednesday they will do more to cut methane emissions and phase out coal this decade. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and the European Union's climate policy chief Frans Timmermans welcomed the news. Mr Guterres wrote on Twitter that ""tackling the climate crisis requires international collaboration and solidarity, and this is an important step in the right direction"".

75,"ALDRICH: COP26 a waste of time, direction and fossil fuels","November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Winnipeg Sun,News,764,COLUMNISTS,764,Canada,Josh AldrichJosh Aldrich,,,,"ALDRICH: COP26 a waste of time, direction and fossil fuels","I hope Prime Minister Justin Trudeau enjoyed his European vacation, virtue signalling with 40,000 others in Glasgow, because the vast majority of Canadians have little faith the vast expenditure of fossil fuels to get there and back will amount to a hill of beans.Even the world's leading teenaged green warrior Greta Thunberg has denounced COP26 as nothing more than a ""PR exercise"" and a ""failure.""It's a whole lot of appearing to be doing something without actually doing anything while drinking their fill of Guiness and Glennfiddich for two weeks .For some reason, this could not have been done over a series of virtual meetings and conferences, as the rest of the world has operated for the last two years. Instead tens of thousands of people - during an active pandemic, mind you - piled into their planes and jets powered by positive thinking and trains and cars fuelled by socially responsible policy to gather together to talk about the wonderful things the rest of the world needs to do.Trudeau and the 200+ (some reports saying as many as 277) Canadian delegates were all-in on more agreenments than one could shake a recycled stick at - including pacts to reduce methane emissions and ending financing of fossil fuel projects that are not carbon neutral, among others - but even if we hit every single goal as a country, it won't make a lick of difference to the global goal.Not when Canada produces about half a gigaton of carbon dioxide with a global output of more than 36 gigatons - that's about 1.3% of total output. We could go down to zero carbon output and the rest of the world would blink and continue on.The world's largest emitter, China, which accounts for 9.3GT or 25.8% of the the world's output, was a no-show for most of the two-week party which wraps up on Friday knowing how much of a political farce it is. Meanwhile Russia, which produces three times the carbon emissions Canada does, and India which produces 2.2 GT a year, are less than enthusiastic in their participation.Canadians see right through this global navel gazing, regardless of their stance on the impacts of climate change.A poll from Angus Reid Institute have 43% of respondents not confident at all that the major global emitters will make meaningful progress on controlling or reducing their emissions coming out of the conference, while another 42% were not that confident. Seven per cent were not sure while only 9% had any faith in the process.The poll also found 71% of respondents believe climate change is fact and is mostly caused by human activities and another 19% believe climate change is fact and is mostly caused by natural changes and cycles.Canada and the rest of the world came up short on the Paris Agreement coming out of COP21 in 2015 and that was initially with the inclusion of China.The world, of course will go through this exercise in global virtue signalling again next year.This, of course, does not mean we need to throw our hands up and say we are screwed. But neither does it mean we should tank our economy all for public appearances while propping up foreign oil from countries that care as much about climate change as that jacked-up F350 that coal rolls you at intersections.We can spout these grandiose ideas about carbon neutral, but we are in no way in a position to turn off the tap, and likely will not be by 2030. Nor should we be going whole hog on technologies like electric cars which may not produce carbon while on the road but have severe environmental impacts at every other stage of their production and life.We also still have not addressed the endangered elephant in the room that we live in an often arctic climate and wind and solar - even in the government's own reports - is less than reliable. It sounds great in Southern California or in the desert, it is something altogether different in Edmonton or Winnipeg or Saskatoon in February.Environmentalism cannot be all about taxing the population through their carbon footprint. We need to focus on better forest management to prevent forest fires which emit massive amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. We need to focus on alternative programs like carbon capture technology and wetland protection and responsible farming - all of which have taken huge strides.But it's not near as sexy on the world scene when you can talk about your badass carbon tax and how you're going to keep oil in the ground, almost just to spite an entire region of your own country.We need real solutions, not handshakes and hollow one-dimensional promises.jaldrich@postmedia.comTwitter: @JoshAldrich03",Copyright 2021 Winnipeg Sun All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|prime,minister,justin,trudeau,enjoyed,european !@PERMALINK=https://winnipegsun.com/opinion/columnists/aldrich-cop26-a-waste-of-time-direction-and-fossil-fuels|CLIMATE CHANGEEMISSIONSGREENHOUSE GASESHEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENTPRIME MINISTERSPOLLS & SURVEYSTALKS & MEETINGSCONFERENCES & CONVENTIONSWRITERSSOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE & LIFESTYLEMANUFACTURING OUTPUTOUTPUT & DEMANDMINING OUTPUTEDITORIALS & OPINIONS|ENERGY & UTILITIESEMISSIONSMETHANEWRITERSMANUFACTURING OUTPUTMINING OUTPUT|JUSTIN TRUDEAUGRETA THUNBERG|WINNIPEG, MB, CANADAGLASGOW, SCOTLAND|MANITOBA, CANADA|CANADA",

Health authorities in Germany reported the maximum of 50,196 new Corona infections to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) within one day. The nationwide seven-day incidence also reached a high of 249.1. The number of Corona patients admitted to hospitals per 100,000 population in a seven-day period was given by the RKI on Thursday as 4.65. The previous high was around 15.5 around Christmas 2020. In light of the steep rise in Corona numbers, the caretaker federal government plans to hold a top-level meeting with state premiers next Thursday. Saxony's Minister President Michael Kretschmer (CDU) called for the cancellation of Christmas markets. Germany's showmen reacted with horror: ""It is unbearable to take the rap for failures of the summer for the second winter in a row,"" said President Albert Ritter of the German Showmen's Association. For better protection against vaccination breakthroughs, Bavaria's Minister President Markus Söder (CSU) wants booster vaccinations after only five months. He also called for a decision by the Conference of State Premiers on a partial vaccination requirement, for example for health care workers.Free voter leaderAiwanger is now vaccinatedAs a top politician not vaccinated against Corona - during the Bundestag election campaign, Free Voters leader Hubert Aiwanger had to listen to quite a bit about that. Now Bavaria's deputy premier has given up his opposition. ""I am meanwhile vaccinated against Corona and can still take 2G appointments in November,"" said Aiwanger. He justified his decision by citing the difficult situation in hospitals, which are facing rapidly rising numbers of Corona intensive care patients. ""This also helps to relieve hospitals. ""SPD, Greens and FDP leadersStarting Monday, it's all about points of contentionAfter two weeks of consultations in working groups, SPD, Greens and FDP want to negotiate on Monday at the top level about the formation of a federal government. The main negotiating group, consisting of 21 representatives of the three parties, will meet at 10 a.m. in Berlin at the state representation in Hamburg, the SPD and FDP announced in identical statements. The negotiations are to take place in seclusion from the public. At the moment, the secretaries-general are in talks about bringing together the papers from the working groups. Then the party leaders are to clarify open questions and points of contention. One of the sticking points of the coalition negotiations: the inheritance tax. FDP leader Christian Lindner rejects the increase brought into play by SPD leader Norbert Walter-Borjans. ""Inheritances are not a benefitless income, but the performance of the predecessors, which has coagulated into property and previously taxed many times,"" Lindner told WELT. Read the interview on page 4.CDU ChairmanshipRöttgen and Braun run for officeBarely a week after the start of the application period, two candidates for the office of CDU chairman have been determined: foreign policy expert Norbert Röttgen and managing chancellery minister Helge Braun. Röttgen had a press conference announced on Thursday for Friday morning on the topic of ""candidacy for the chairmanship of the CDU of Germany "". Braun announced that he would also officially submit his candidacy on Friday, as a spokesperson for the Hessian CDU state parliamentary group confirmed. WELT had already reported on his candidacy. Another possible candidate is the financial expert Friedrich Merz. Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn, who is still in office, has announced that he will not run.Defendant in concentration camp trialDefence lawyer announces statementWill he make a detailed statement after all? In the trial about the mass killings of prisoners in the Nazi concentration camp Sachsenhausen, the defense attorney has announced a possible statement by the defendant about his activities during World War II. ""There will probably be a statement on this, but that will take some time,"" lawyer Stefan Waterkamp told the Neuruppin Regional Court. Previously, the lawyer for the Nebenkläger Thomas Walther, as well as the presiding judge Udo Lechtermann, urged the 100-year-old defendant to confess to his activities at the time. According to the indictment, the now centenarian is said to have aided and abetted the murder of thousands of prisoners as an SS guard in the concentration camp from 1942 to 1945. On the second day of the trial, however, he denied having worked in the concentration camp. Read more about the trial on page 6.Foreign PolicyBelarusLukashenko threatens gas cut-offThe refugee dispute between the EU and Belarus continues to escalate: Belarusian ruler Alexander Lukashenko has threatened to cut off gas supplies to Europe in the event of further EU sanctions. Earlier, the EU had announced new sanctions for next week. ""If they impose new sanctions on us, we will have to react,"" Lukashenko said, according to state news agency Belta. ""And what if we cut off gas supplies?"" Russia, meanwhile, has dispatched two nuclear-capable warplanes on a training mission over Belarus, observers see as a signal of support for Lukashenko. Tensions are also rising in the border region. Read more on page 9.COP26 in GlasgowPraise for US-Chinese agreementThere is cautious praise for the agreement between China and the US announced at the world climate conference. ""It can only be a good thing that the US and China are working closely together on climate change and cutting back on methane gas emissions,"" judged Bernice Lee, research director at think tank Chatham House. However, she said, the joint statement by the two countries was not enough. ""The real test for Washington and Beijing is how hard they push here in Glasgow for an agreement in line with the 1.5-degree target,"" Lee added. The announcement by the US and China had caused a stir on Wednesday night. In it, the world's two largest greenhouse gas emitters stressed ""the seriousness and urgency of the climate crisis."" Read on page 9 how the declaration came about and what Washington and Beijing have agreed.Mercenary deployment in MaliRussia rejects concernsTrouble is programmed: Russia rejects French concerns about the possible deployment of Russian mercenaries in Mali - opposing the Paris government's West Africa policy. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday spoke of nervousness among representatives of France and other Western states. Whether to use the services of a private Russian military company was ""at the exclusive discretion of the legitimate government in Mali,"" Lavrov said a day before talks in Paris are to touch on the issue. Along with France, Germany also strongly opposes a deployment of Russia's Wagner mercenary group in Mali. France is fighting Islamist groups in West Africa with several thousand troops. Germany is participating in operations in Mali with more than 1000 soldiers. The former French colony is ruled by the military. The generals have so far delayed the promised return to democracy.HungaryPetrol prices to be cappedFaced with rapidly rising fuel prices, Hungary's government officially sets the maximum price for gasoline. A liter of super (95 octane) as well as a liter of diesel may cost a maximum of 480 forints (1.33 euros) each as of November 15. This was announced by Gergely Gulyas, Minister of the Chancellery. The regulation does not apply to other types of gasoline. It will remain in force for three months. Currently, a litre of super (95 octane) costs an average of 506 forints in Hungary, a litre of diesel 512 forints.Head of the last apartheid governmentSouth Africa's ex-president de Klerk deadHe was called a traitor and awarded the Nobel Peace Prize: Frederik Willem de Klerk. Now he has died of cancer at the age of 85. He was the last president of the racist apartheid system in South Africa and had campaigned in the early 1990s for the abolition of racial segregation and the release from prison of his eventual successor, Nelson Mandela. In 1993, de Klerk and Mandela were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Twenty years later, de Klerk said his decision had averted ""a catastrophe "", freed whites from their ""isolation and guilt"" and enabled blacks to achieve ""dignity and equality "".KnowledgeBefore the boosterIs the antibody test worth it?Significantly more vaccinations against the coronavirus are being given again in Germany. According to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), 368,000 people had themselves injected on Wednesday. Of these, 246,000 were booster vaccinations alone. On Tuesday, 312,000 people had been immunized - the highest number since August. At least 67.3 percent of the population is now fully vaccinated. A third dose has already been given to 3.3 million people. In the course of the booster vaccinations, antibody tests are being discussed. They are supposed to show whether the vaccination has taken effect and whether a third vaccination is necessary at all. What significance these tests have and for whom they are useful is explained by Professor Harald Renz of the University Hospital Giessen and Marburg in the interview on page 24.European Medicines AgencyCovid drugs approvedThe European Medicines Agency (EMA) has cleared the way for the approval of two new drugs against Covid-19: the antibody therapy Ronapreve of the Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche and the drug Regkirona (Regdanvimab) of the manufacturer Celltrion from South Korea. Clinical tests had attested a very good effectiveness to the preparations. Corona therapy with Ronapreve significantly reduces the viral load in corona patients. However, the drug must be administered shortly after the onset of symptoms. It is recommended for those patients who do not yet require ventilation but are at increased risk of severe disease progression. The same applies to Regkirona.MeaslesMillions of children not protectedThe Corona Year 2020 has significantly increased the risk of devastating measles outbreaks. This is according to an analysis by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Worldwide, 22 million young children had not received their first measles vaccination, three million more than the year before. This was the largest increase in two decades. According to the report, only 70 percent of children received the second dose needed for full vaccination protection in 2020. According to the WHO, 95 percent of people worldwide would have to be fully vaccinated in order to completely prevent outbreaks. The development can be attributed to exit restrictions as well as the fact that the pandemic has involved health personnel in many places. The number of reported cases decreased, but WHO and CDC assume that in many places the data was not or insufficiently collected.Flight to ISS space stationAstronaut Maurer finally in spaceThis time it worked: After various postponements, German astronaut Matthias Maurer has left for the International Space Station ISS. The 51-year-old astronaut from the German state of Saarland took off on Thursday from the Cape Canaveral Cosmodrome with three Nasa colleagues on board a ""Crew Dragon"" of the space company SpaceX. This is the first time a German astronaut has been in space in three years. ""From my point of view, it was a great start,"" said Maurer's colleague Alexander Gerst, who was previously the last German on the ISS in 2018. The launch, originally planned for the last weekend of October, had previously been postponed several times - first because of bad weather conditions, then because of a ""minor medical problem"" with one of the crew members, and finally another crew had to be retrieved from the ISS first.Economy and moneyGeneral ElectricThe decline of a US iconLong-established US industrial giant General Electric (GE) has announced plans to split itself up. The aerospace, healthcare and energy divisions are to be split into three independent companies. Founded at the end of the 19th century, the company was long a flagship of US industry. Read on page 15 how the company went down - and how it is to go up again.IncomeThe 100,000-Euro ClubA good salary is an important prerequisite for making a decent fortune. 100.100,000 per year is what 1.4 million employees earn each year, according to the Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft (IW). This means that almost every 25th employee in Germany earns six figures. But how does one get to an income of ""100K "", as it is called in the language of personnel managers? The answers can be found in the study by the job portal StepStone, which, like WELT, belongs to Axel Springer. Read more on page 19.Still in DecemberDaimler Truck goes publicIn the course of the split-up of the Daimler group, the truck and bus business is to be listed on the Frankfurt stock exchange on December 10. Daimler Truck expects to qualify for the Dax stock market index as early as the first quarter of 2022, the group said. The Stuttgart-based company is currently undergoing a transformation: Mercedes cars and trucks will soon operate separately as independent companies. The group wants the separation to strengthen the value and competitiveness of the divisions.Real estate giant EvergrandeInterest at the last minuteThe highly indebted real estate group China Evergrande has once again saved itself at the last moment. Just before a grace period expired, Evergrande paid interest to bondholders. It was the third time in a few weeks that Evergrande paid bond interest at the last minute. For weeks, investors have feared that the problems of Evergrande and other real estate developers would rock the financial system in China. The interest now being served was actually due in October.After the summer dramaRun on flood insuranceAfter the flood disaster in the Rhineland and the Eifel, demand for building insurance against floods and heavy rain is picking up significantly. ""Insurers registered around 400,000 new natural hazard insurance policies for residential buildings in the third quarter,"" the German Insurance Association announced. Normal in a quarter would be 50,000 to 100,000 new contracts.DaxFirst record high, then weaknessOn Thursday, investors on the German stock market did not venture out of hiding very much. Although the Dax briefly climbed to a record high of just under 16,115 points, it then immediately lost momentum again. It ended the day up 0.1 percent at 16,083.11 points. As has been the case since the end of last week, the leading index continued to move in a very narrow trading range. The MDax index of mid-cap stocks lost 0.10 percent to 35,956.31 points on Thursday. For more stock market data, see page 11.SportsCricketShadows on the booming sportThe World Cup final in cricket will be held in Dubai on Sunday. The sport is currently breaking records worldwide; a match in the World Cup between India and Pakistan was watched by almost 170 million people. Only in Germany is the interest limited. The arrival of refugees five years ago has led to an enormous growth in the sport in this country. 1200 players in 70 teams became 7000 in 370 teams. But now match-fixing is threatening the credibility - and the upswing. According to information from WELT, sports court proceedings are underway against more than half a dozen players. Read about the consequences on page 23.New coachSteven Gerrard to save VillaSteven Gerrard is the new coach of English Premier League club Aston Villa. The ex-Liverpool FC captain was unbeaten in the Scottish Football Championship last season with Glasgow Rangers and succeeds Dean Smith, who has taken leave of absence. Aston Villa had recently conceded five straight defeats and sit 16th in the table with just ten points after eleven matchdays. Gerrard played almost exclusively for Liverpool FC throughout his professional career and became a club icon with the Reds between 1998 and 2015, making over 500 competitive appearances.Culture and societyMainzDörte Hansen becomes writer-in-residenceThe writer and journalist Dörte Hansen will be Mainz's writer-in-residence in 2022. The ZDF and the city of Mainz announced that the award would be given to an author who is loved by readers and literary critics. The prize jury paid tribute to the ""bitterly tender village novels"" of the author from Husum, who has already won several awards. Her first novel ""Altes Land "", which was later made into a film, was published in 2015. Hansen's second novel ""Mittagsstunde"" tells the story of a village in North Friesland. In addition to the prize money of 12,500 euros, the Stadtschreiber award also grants a one-year right of residence in the Stadtschreiber apartment at the Gutenberg Museum in Mainz.Drawings and film scenesFellini at the Folkwang ""From drawing to film"" - under this motto, an exhibition at the Folkwang Museum in Essen takes a look at the creative process of filmmaker Federico Fellini (1920-1993). On show from 12 November to 20 February are around 220 drawings by Fellini from the 1950s to the early 1980s. The drawings were indispensable tools for Fellini himself and for his collaborators, make-up artists and costume producers, the museum explained. They are juxtaposed with the film scenes actually realised later in the form of film clips, script excerpts or film posters.Emergency numbersDefect paralyses 110 and 112The nationwide breakdown of the emergency numbers 110 and 112 on Thursday morning was probably caused by a technical defect. ""We rule out a hacker attack as the cause,"" a Telekom spokesman said. ""The cause of the disruption was probably the introduction of new software, which had previously been extensively tested and had not shown any abnormalities. The Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) also said: ""There are no indications of a cyber attack."" Criticism came from the police union (GdP): life-critical numbers such as 110 must have double technical protection.Disclaimer: Translation automatically generated.

Diego Pacheco, lead negotiator of Bolivia on behalf of LMDC, said that 60% of the carbon space was occupied by developed countries with only 18% of the population, and that their historical responsibility in causing the climate crisis cannot be ignored.

80,COP26: Fossil fuel pledges 'critically weakened' as talks enter final phase,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Herald Scotland,News,1257,,1257,Scotland,David Bol,,GREENPEACE INTERNATIONAL,GREENPEACE INTERNATIONAL,COP26: Fossil fuel pledges 'critically weakened' as talks enter final phase,"AN UPDATED draft deal that could be agreed at COP26 appears to have ""critically weakened\xE2 a push to phase out the burning of fossil fuels - amid calls for more work to strengthen pledges as talks enter the final phase.Greenpeace said that despite wording being watered down on ending fossil fuels, \xE2it\xE2s still there and needs to be strengthened again before the summit closes\xE2.The first draft of the \xE2cover decision\xE2 for the overarching agreement at the summit called for countries \xE2to accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels\xE2.But in a new draft published on Friday morning, that statement has been changed to calling on countries to accelerate the shift to clean energy systems, \xE2including by rapidly scaling up clean power generation and accelerating the phaseout of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels\xE2.With much of the focus on ending the use of coal, very little has been discussed broadly about ending the use of fossil fuels for energy systems.The inclusion of a reference to fossil fuels was a first for a UN decision document of this type but was expected to get fierce pushback from some countries \xE2 and still may not survive to the final text.Greenpeace International executive director, Jennifer Morgan, said: \xE2It could be better, it should be better, and we have one day left to make it a lot, lot better.READ MORE:\xC2COP26: Sturgeon tells Boris Johnson to return to Glasgow to 'drive this deal over the line'\xE2Right now the fingerprints of fossil fuel interests are still on the text and this is not the breakthrough deal that people hoped for in Glasgow.\xE2The key line on phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies has been critically weakened, but it\xE2s still there and needs to be strengthened again before this summit closes. That\xE2s going to be a big tussle and one we need to win.\xE2She added: \xE2But there\xE2s wording in here worth holding on to and the UK presidency needs to fight tooth and nail to keep the most ambitious elements in the deal.""We\xE2ve moved from richer nations largely ignoring the pleas of developing countries for promised finance to tackle climate change, to the beginnings of a recognition that their calls should be met. Now we need developed countries to scale up their offer of support and finance.\xE2Negotiators in Glasgow simply have to seize the moment and agree something historic, but they need to isolate the governments who\xE2ve come here to wreck progress and instead listen to the calls of youth and vulnerable nations.\xE2Talks went on through the night and look set to overrun from their finish time of Friday evening as negotiators come under pressure to resolve issues around finance for poor countries, fossil fuels, the efforts of countries to cut emissions in the 2020s and rules on carbon markets and transparency.The latest draft appears to have strengthened language on getting countries to \xE2revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets\xE2 in their national action plans by the end of 2022 to align with global goals to limit temperature rises to \xE2well below\xE2 2C and try to limit them to 1.5C.READ MORE:\xC2COP26: Sturgeon confirms Scotland 'considering joining' alliance to end oil and gas useThe new version \xE2requests\xE2 countries do so, compared to the previous version which \xE2urges\xE2 them to do so.Michael Jacobs, former climate adviser to Gordon Brown and veteran of Cop talks, said UK, EU and UNFCCC lawyers were saying that \xE2requests\xE2 was stronger language than \xE2urges\xE2.He said: \xE2I see this as a strengthening of the language which effectively means countries are being told to come back next year with nationally determined contributions aligned to the 1.5C temperature goal.\xE2Scientists have warned that keeping temperature rises to 1.5C \xE2 beyond which the worst impacts of climate change will be felt \xE2 requires global emissions to be cut by 45% by 2030, and to zero overall by mid-century.But current action plans known as nationally determined contributions for emissions cuts up to 2030 leave the world well off track to meet the goal, and could see warming of 2.4C over the long term.So countries are under pressure to rapidly increase their ambition for emission cuts in the 2020s to stop the 1.5C goal slipping out of reach.There is now a date \xE2 missing from the first draft \xE2 for when developed countries should double the provision of finance to help developing countries adapt to climate change \xE2 by 2025.Providing finance for developing countries to develop cleanly, adapt to the impacts of climate change and address the loss and damage to people, livelihoods, land and infrastructure already being hit by increasing weather extremes and rising seas is also key to securing a deal in Glasgow.Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Nicola Sturgeon said the updated draft agreement is \xE2slightly better\xE2 but it \xE2still has a way to go\xE2 to be sufficient.The First Minister added: \xE2So, it is in many respects slightly better than the draft that was published earlier in the week, but it still has a way to go.\xE2So, on the upside, you know, there\xE2s a clear recognition that 1.5 degrees is the goal in terms of limiting global warming. There seems to be movement on adaptation finance, there is wording on loss and damage.\xE2Ms Sturgeon said: \xE2On the downside, still not a delivery of the 100 billion dollars financial commitment (from developed nations to vulnerable countries), the expression of regret and disappointment \xE2 but the people who are expressing regret are the people who can deliver it. So hopefully we\xE2ll see that change.\xE2And still the fact that, although there is a recognition that 1.5 degrees is the goal, we are way off track to actually meet that, we\xE2re still on a track for a world of 2.4 degrees global warming.

81,"COP26 stokes optimism, but action must follow","November 12, 2021 Friday",International,China Daily,News,686,,686,"China, People's Republic of",China Daily Global,,,,"COP26 stokes optimism, but action must follow","By Arvea Marieni | China Daily Global | Updated: 2021-11-12 09:05A general view of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland, Britain, Nov 11, 2021. [Photo/Agencies]It has become clear at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP 26, in Glasgow, Scotland, that the climate challenge is perceived as global.The tone has changed, as noted by Youssef Nassef, director of the UN Adaptation Division of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, who said that in the history of the conferences, ""there has never been such a large number of voluntary initiatives"".The question is whether this consensus is also reflected in global determination to substantially reform the economic system. That is a different order of challenge that is nothing less than civilizational. As Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said right before COP 26, ""We are changing the economic system.""The focus rests on how to bring to the mainstream the innovation to accelerate the transition to a post-fossil fuel economy. The first step, however, is to build a new system of rules for the ecological industrial system. New policies must be designed to ensure the scalability of solutions and the transformation of markets. A whole-economy carbon (and resource) price is what we need. This will transform our societies and the way we all live.However, in the history of climate negotiations, while environment ministers have made commitments to reduce carbon emissions, their colleagues in energy, agriculture and finance posts have promoted policies to support the production and consumption of fossil fuels. This contradiction has marked the entire long journey of the COPs.The global environmental challenge of climate change requires policies both to reduce the carbon intensity of the economy as well as to enhance natural carbon sinks. Energy, industry, transportation, agriculture, and taxation and incentives are the main sectoral policies to be involved in addressing climate change.To address environmental challenges, environmental management needs to shift toward social and industrial systems. We need to use carbon less intensively while bolstering the resilience of the environment by enhancing carbon sinks-things such as plants, soil and oceans that absorb more carbon from the atmosphere than they release.The rules of the new economy are simple: To bring climate regulation to the mainstream, we need to internalize the external environmental damage. Once these externalities are integrated into the market system, energy producers and national economies will have a level playing field. This industrial, economic and social revolution needs to happen quickly and globally.There is a sense of urgency. China's climate envoy, Xie Zhenhua, believes that a broad deal on carbon markets is becoming possible. German State Secretary for the Environment Jochen Flasbarth said, ""The new normal of COP 26 is speeding things up"".Eventually, how we build forward better will make or break the success of the ecological transition. Even more than before, truly ecological standards are needed.What we need is an orderly transition. If rich states are unwilling to assume a fair share of the cost, in their own interest, we will all fail. The main task lies with private and green finance. New mechanisms are needed to address this demand.In addition, technical negotiations that revolve around clauses of the Paris climate agreement are moving on in Glasgow, with China playing an active role. As European Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans said, the Chinese ""are ambitious on the transition to renewables"".Beijing has put a concrete program on the table, and it has already been converted into law. The European Union is banking on collaboration.After the injection of optimism in Glasgow, it's time to move from words to deeds.

It was hugely uplifting though to join climate activists, scientists, students, faith groups, Green politicians and others in what was the biggest demonstration in Scotland in living memory, and just one of dozens of climate marches across the UK - and when a rainbow lit up the sky at one point it really did feel like a symbol of the hope rising from the crowds.My weekEVERY day at COP26 has a theme and Monday's was loss and damage.

91,"COP26 | China, US pledge to increase cooperation at UN climate talks","November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Macau Daily Times,News,981,,981,"China, People's Republic of",,,,,"COP26 | China, US pledge to increase cooperation at UN climate talks","  The world's top carbon polluters, China and the United States, agreed yesterday [Macau time] to increase their cooperation and speed up action to rein in climate-damaging emissions, signaling a mutual effort on global warming at a time of tension over their other disputes. In back-to-back news conferences at U.N. climate talks in Glasgow, Chinese climate envoy Xie Zhenhua and U.S. counterpart John Kerry said the two countries would work together to accelerate the emissions reductions required to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. ""It's beneficial not only to our two countries but the world as a whole that two major powers in the world, China and the U.S., shoulder special international responsibilities and obligations,"" Xie told reporters. ""We need to think big and be responsible."" ""The steps we're taking ... can answer questions people have about the pace at which China is going, and help China and us to be able to accelerate our efforts,"" Kerry said. China also agreed for the first time to crack down on methane leaks, following the lead of the Biden administration's efforts to curb the potent greenhouse gas. Beijing and Washington agreed to share technology to reduce emissions. Governments agreed in Paris to jointly cut greenhouse gas emissions enough to keep the global temperature rise ""well below"" 2 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times, with a more stringent target of trying to keep warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius preferred. Both sides recognize that there is a gap between efforts taken globally to reduce climate pollution and the goals of the Paris deal, Xie said. ""So we will jointly strengthen climate action and cooperation with respect to our respective national situations,"" he said. A U.S.-China bilateral agreement in 2014 gave a huge push to the creation of the historic Paris accord the following year, but that cooperation stopped with the Trump administration, which pulled the U.S. out of the pact. The Biden administration brought the U.S. back in to that deal, but has clashed with China on other issues such as cybersecurity, human rights and Chinese territorial claims. ""While this is not a gamechanger in the way the 2014 US-China climate deal was, in many ways it's just as much of a step forward given the geopolitical state of the relationship,"" said Thom Woodroofe, an expert in U.S.-China climate talks. ""It means the intense level of US-China dialogue on climate can now begin to translate into cooperation."" The gesture of goodwill comes just days after President Joe Biden blamed Chinese President Xi Jinping's and Russian President Vladimir Putin's failure to attend talks in person for the lack of more progress in climate negotiations. The U.S. and China will also revive a working group that will ""meet regularly to address the climate crisis and advance the multilateral process, focusing on enhancing concrete actions in this decade,"" the declaration said. Both Washington and Beijing intend to update the world on their new national targets for 2035 in 2025 - a move that is particularly significant for China. The declaration also said China will ""make best efforts to accelerate"" its plans to reduce coal consumption in the second half of this decade. The announcement came as governments from around the world were negotiating in Glasgow about how to build on the Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect vulnerable countries from the impacts of global warming. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres called the move ""an important step in the right direction."" Some experts noted the deal was short on commitments that would significantly reduce heat-trapping gases. ""It's a good sign that the world's two biggest emitters can actually work together to face the biggest crisis of humanity but there's not a lot of meat there after the methane stuff,'' said Byford Tsang a China policy analyst for the European think tank E3G. Earlier, a draft of a larger deal being negotiated by almost 200 countries in Glasgow called for accelerating the phasing out of coal - the single biggest source of man-made emissions - although it set no timeline. Setting deadlines for phasing out fossil fuels is highly sensitive to countries that still depend on them for economic growth, including China and India, and to major exporters of coal such as Australia. The future of coal is also a hot-button issue in the U.S., where a spat among Democrats has held up one of President Joe Biden's signature climate bills. Greenpeace International director Jennifer Morgan, a long-time climate talks observer, said that the call in the draft to phase out coal would be a first in a U.N. climate deal, but the lack of a timeline would limit the pledge's effectiveness. ""This isn't the plan to solve the climate emergency. This won't give the kids on the streets the confidence that they'll need,"" Morgan said. The draft also expresses ""alarm and concern"" about how much Earth has already warmed and urges countries to cut carbon dioxide emissions by about half by 2030. Pledges so far from governments don't add up to that frequently stated goal. The draft is likely to change, but it doesn't yet include full agreements on the three major goals that the U.N. set going into the negotiations: for rich nations to give poorer ones $100 billion a year in climate aid, to ensure that half of that money goes to adapting to worsening global warming, and the pledge to slash global carbon emissions by 2030. It acknowledges ""with regret"" that rich nations have failed to live up to the climate finance pledge. Currently they are providing around $80 billion a year, which poorer nations that need financial help both in developing green energy systems and adapting to the worst of climate change say isn't enough.

The new draft text has changed the language on several fronts to strike a compromise with dissenting parties.The new draft reaffirms the Paris Agreement temperature goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels.Instead of ""urging"" parties to revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their nationally determined contributions, as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022, the new draft ""requests"" parties to revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets.The draft has removed the bit on the need to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C by 2100. It now states that it, ""recognizes that limiting global warming to 1.5 degC requires rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions.""Experts said the draft strikes a balance between the asks of developed and developing countries. The text will be negotiated through Friday.The Like-Minded Developing Countries, including India and China, had objected to this timeline for revisiting the targets. The previous draft had called upon parties to ""accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels"" which has now been reworded to ""adoption of policies for the transition towards low-emission energy systems, including by rapidly scaling up clean power generation and accelerating the phaseout of unabated coal power and inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels."" Saudi Arabia had objected to the clause on fossil fuels while several developing countries had raised concerns with phasing out of coal.There are no major changes to the rest of the text. In summary, the draft continues to recognise the 1.5-degrees global warming goal. It also recognizes that limiting global warming to 1.5 degC requires rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions, including reducing global carbon dioxide emissions by 45% by 2030 relative to the 2010 level and net-zero around mid-century, as well as deep reductions in non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases.The language on finance is slightly stronger. ""Notes with deep regret that the goal of developed country parties to mobilize jointly USD 100 billion per year by 2020 in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation has not yet been met."" The draft urges developed country parties to fully deliver on the USD 100 billion goal urgently and through to 2025 and emphasizes the importance of transparency in the implementation of their pledges. It also urges the operating entities of the Financial Mechanism, multilateral development banks and other financial institutions to further scale up investments in climate action and calls for a continued increase in the scale and effectiveness of climate finance from all sources globally, including grants and other highly concessional forms of finance.The draft only re-emphasizes the need for scaled-up financial resources to vulnerable countries and encourages relevant multilateral institutions to consider how climate vulnerabilities should be reflected in the provision and mobilization of concessional financial resources and other forms of support, including Special Drawing Rights.""The text fails to deliver on strong climate action. Only 'inefficient' fossil fuel subsidies need to go out, other subsidies can continue. Coal power need not be phased out, only 'unabated' coal power needs to be phased out. Basically, the updated text is about 'we want everyone to be happy' rather than 'we want everyone to be ambitious.' On finance, the only thing developing countries have got is a more aggressive 'tone' in the text, rather than anything meaningful. So, it is 'deeply regretted' that the 100 bn target is not achieved, and developed parties are 'urged' to meet this by 2025.

It also ""urges"" developed country parties to provide funds for the technical facility and for the operation of the Santiago network.""The financial facility for loss and damage is very useful.

In the pattern of its grain you can see its species. In the chemical isotopes locked inside it you can determine the soil that nourished it.And in these factors combined is the signature that tells you whether it should be in that wardrobe at all or whether it was illegally logged.At the Glasgow climate conference, more than 100 of the world's key logging nations have agreed to end deforestation by 2030. Now scientists are providing the technology that could mean that is more than merely words.By building a library in Kew of tree samples from around the world, scientists believe that, ultimately, they could take a sliver of wood and determine what bend of which river in which forest it came from and whether it should, by law, have been left in that forest.Victor Deklerck, from Kew Gardens, said: ""This is about the destruction of nature reserves and the annihilation of species. It is the biggest wildlife crime.""The UN estimates that it is the world's most profitable natural resource crime, with between one in ten and one in three logs traded in the world felled from ostensibly protected regions. A big difficulty in combating it is tracing provenance.Deklerck is working with colleagues around the world on the World Forest ID programme to take samples of trees from the regions most likely to provide legitimate and illicit logging. By building up a library, they are already able to often tell customs officials if a log's provenance is genuine, pinning down both its species and the place it was grown.This, he said, gives them ""the weapons to fight unsustainable logging"". When integrated with satellite data, which can spot recently felled woods, it could be used to pin down the routes taken by logs that have been removed.",Copyright 2021 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper; Web Publication|WEBTTO|ENGLISH|ILLEGAL LOGGINGNEGATIVE NEWSNEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWSSCIENCE & TECHNOLOGYWILDLIFEDEFORESTATIONNATURAL RESOURCESEXCISE & CUSTOMSCONFERENCES & CONVENTIONS|FORESTRY & LOGGINGILLEGAL LOGGINGLOGGING INDUSTRYDEFORESTATION|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND",

Alternately, it suggests parties will define an annual mobilisation goal in the form of an ambitious figure, taking into account the needs and priorities of developing countries as expressed in NDCs. The third option agrees that the deliberations on the quantum mobilisation target should start from range of a commitment by developed countries to mobilise jointly at least $1.3 trillion per year by 2030, of which 50% will be for mitigation and 50% for adaptation, and a significant percentage on a grant basis from a floor of $100 billion. While this third option is what many developing countries have been asking for, it remains to be seen if it makes way into the final text.On long term finance, there are two sections that could be of importance to developing countries -- coming up with a multilaterally agreed definition on climate finance, and establishing a measurement and tracking platform to be maintained by the secretariat. The draft also has an option that suggests all discussions on long term finance have been completed in 2020 and will not progress.""The thing to be careful of here is that most of the points are bracketed and are still being debated. So, these are not final and there is a very good chance that these will remain provisional even after COP,"" said Arjun Dutt, programme lead at Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) adding that ""the decision text contains elements of the characteristics of climate finance demanded by developing countries (new and additional, grant-based financing).

98,Forget 'peak oil': COP26 may have hit peak climate hysteria,"November 12, 2021 Friday",Pennsylvania,The Philadelphia Inquirer,News,815,OPINION;Pg. A10,815,,GEORGE WILL @GeorgeWillRSS,,,,Forget 'peak oil': COP26 may have hit peak climate hysteria,"WASHINGTON - Peak oil production has been postponed, again. Peak hysteria about climate change, however, might have been passed.In 1914, the government said U.S. oil reserves would be exhausted by 1924. In 1939, it said the world's reserves would last 13 years. Then oil fueled a global war and the post-war economic boom, and in 1951 the government said the world had 13 years of remaining reserves. In 1970, the world's proven reserves were estimated to be 612 billion barrels. More than 767 billion were pumped by 2006, when proven reserves were 1.2 trillion. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter predicted the exhaustion of the world's proven reserves ""by the end of the next decade."" By 2009, the world had consumed three times more than 1977's proven 1.2 trillion barrels, and today's proven reserves are above 1.5 trillion.All this disappointed those who desire scarcity of everything but government, which they think can engineer comprehensive social change by becoming the allocator of scarce resources. Such people filled the Glasgow, Scotland, streets outside the climate summit chanting ""System change not climate change.""The 33-year-old student who told the New York Times ""We need a whole system change"" was correct: The ""system"" - industrialism, enterprise, markets, economic development that expands the global middle class, economic growth that funds the social safety nets of developed nations with aging populations - is incompatible with ""keep 1.5 alive."" Meaning the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius(2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).This limitation will not happen. This nonoccurrence will be tolerable.Since 2010, the New York Times reports, the great majority of the $1.1 trillion of private equity energy sector investments have been in fossil fuels, just 12% in renewables. The stock prices of major U.S. coal-mining companies rose at least 145% in the past 12 months. The amount of coal used this year to generate U.S. electricity will be more than 20% above last year's amount. This might be a short-term phenomenon, produced by declining oil prices that cut shale operations and natural gas production. But nothing is more expectable than the regular occurrence of unexpected things, such as the awkward decline of Northern Europe's power-generating winds as Glasgow drew near. (Fossil fuel-generated electricity kept the lights on for the enlightened.)The Energy Information Administration projects that fossil fuels, which were 84.2% of global energy consumption in 2010, will decline only to 70% in 2050. India, which no later than six years hence will have the world's largest population, and which already is the world's third-largest source of greenhouse gases, said at Glasgow it will try to achieve net zero carbon emissions - by 2070.India, with one-thirtieth the U.S per capita gross domestic product, cannot be faulted for barely disguising its Scarlett O'Hara stance regarding climate change: ""I'll think about that tomorrow."" Consider all that was unimaginable about 2021 in 1972: the transformation to a service economy, air conditioning - an adaptation to difficult climate - that enabled the Sun Belt to boom, etc. Now, imagine how remote 2021 will seem in 2070, when the world certainly will have unimagined worries of currently unknowable natures.The Hoover Institution's John H. Cochrane, a.k.a. the Grumpy Economist, notes that even with extreme assumptions about increased global temperature and negligible adaptation measures, it is difficult to postulate a cost larger than 5% of global GDP by 2100. Even assuming meager 2% growth, U.S. GDP in 2100 will be 400% larger than now. At 3% compounded growth, there will be 1,000% more GDP than now. From 1940 to 2000, Cochrane reminds, there was 3.8% compound annual growth, and GDP increased 10-fold.Cochrane says: Suppose, implausibly, that Miami might be six feet below sea level in 2100. Amsterdam has been such for centuries. It built dikes. By hand. There is, he notes, ""great disdain for adaptation."" Of course: The disdainers worry that adaptation might obviate the need for radical government micromanagement of life.Cost-benefit analyses illuminate choices and budget constraints. ""Without numbers,"" Cochrane warns, ""we will follow fashion. Today it's windmills, solar panels, and electric cars. Yesterday it was high-speed trains. The day before it was corn ethanol and switchgrass.""Tomorrow? There will be other prospective salvations. But, says Cochrane: ""Notice how our policy-makers never tell us how much they think each new policy will reduce year 2100 global temperature or raise year 2100 GDP. The reason is that the numbers are tiny."" The gigantic numbers concern the resources we will squander until we follow numbers rather than fashions.George F.

According to a report published in the Hindustan Times--Livemint's sister publication, four students and two teachers from IIT Bombay have won a grant of $250,000 (approximately Rs.1.85 crore) for the new-age technology at the Sustainable Innovation Forum at COP-26 in Glasgow.The grant has come from XPRIZE Foundation in collaboration with Elon Musk Foundation. XPRIZE is the global leader in designing and implementing innovative competition models to solve the world's grandest challenges.A team of students --Srinath Iyer (PhD student), Anwesha Banerjee (PhD student), Srushti Bhamare (BTech+MTech student), and Shubham Kumar (Junior Research fellow-Earth Science) have created a tri-modular technology that can capture carbon dioxide from point sources of emission and transforming them into salts. It is the only team from India to win this award.XPRIZE and the Musk Foundation announced a grant of US$100 million (around Rs.745 crore) in April this year for anyone who can come up with sustainable technology for carbon removal from the atmosphere. Of this US$5 million (around Rs.37 crore) was a student award.To win the prize, participants had to demonstrate a working solution on a scale of at least 1000 tonnes removed per year and to show a pathway of achieving a scale of gigatones per year in the future.Arnab Dutta, department chemistry & (IDPCS), one of the two mentors part of this project told the daily that his team has not only tried to capture the carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere but has also turned that into another commercially viable chemicals in industries ensuring a financial benefit to them.""Our suggestion is to not only capture this CO2 emitted by industries but also turn it into other commercially viable chemicals in industries ensuring a financial benefit to them while implementing this unique CO2 management programme,"" Datta said.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MINT.

101,Cop26: Compromise in the face of calamity,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),News,2376,"INDEPENDENT PREMIUM,LONG READS;Version:1",2376,England & Wales,Kate Hughes,,,,Cop26: Compromise in the face of calamity,"This, we were reminded endlessly in the weeks leading up to the UN climate conference in Glasgow, was our last chance.The build-up to Cop26, against a backdrop of increasingly extreme weather and barely a whisper on the subject at the G20 meeting that preceded it, was gloomy, bordering on fatalistic.Even before it started, and in the face of multiple unmistakable warnings of imminent and widespread environmental collapse, the Glasgow meeting was written off as hopeless, pointless and scarily weak on both the delivery of previous commitments and a consensus over the need for new, stronger ones.It didn't help that major and powerful polluters didn't turn up at all and or that others reneged on their pledges within hours - such as Indonesia over the apparent all-star, big win for the planet - the ""agreement"" to end deforestation by 2030.India pledged to achieve carbon neutrality, but only by 2070, and Saudi Arabia's contingent pushed hard to wipe out the ""keep 1.5 alive"" message altogether.Nor, because it didn't even make it onto the conference timetable, was there any kind of a consensus on reducing the impact of the global meat and dairy industry. And yet, if left unchecked, the forecasted growth in that industry could mean that by 2050, the livestock sector could account for 80 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas 'budget'.Meanwhile, anxious and desperate campaigners, many of them children, demonstrated outside the centre and in cities around the world, prevented from being able to look those leaders - described more than once in the last fortnight as stale, male and pale - in the eye as time after time they drew a line through actions that could have secured a stable future. Again.                     Blah blah blah                   The rhetoric started strong. The grandiose statements at the beginning of last week came thick and fast as leader after leader got up to urge everyone else in the room to step up, to follow them into battle. But somehow they still failed to reach sufficient consensus to make changes to stop the rot that is already undermining economic and therefore their own political strength around the world.Even if the pledges thrashed out in Glasgow had held for more than a few hours and the people doing the real work in the background - most of whom are still pulling all-nighters in the Scottish city to get some strategic meat on the bones and somehow deliver on the promises made - it won't be nearly good enough.We are still miles off the limits set in Paris to avoid ""catastrophic"" climate change.Research group the Climate Action Tracker has calculated that the nations' current plans for emissions reductions by the end of this decade will still result in 2.4C of heating by the end of the century.                     Every business has faced strategic challenges of this kind before. When the future attacks the present, the answer is never to protect the present. It is always to run to the futureTake into account the plans that were thrashed out at Cop and within nine years we will be collectively pumping out greenhouse gases that are twice the amount that would meet the 1.5C Paris Agreement aspiration.It makes frustratingly little sense to the billions of us who didn't attend the event. We sit at assume, assuming glumly that they were weighed down by the scale of the problem, by the bottom line, or by lobbyists peddling short-term economic and political positions, such as the massive fossil fuel contingent whose number eclipsed that of any single nation in attendance.Maybe they also missed the presentation by the CBI's director general Tony Danker, who reminded the gathering - which this year included a record number of CEOs - that net zero is no longer about reputation, it is about commercial opportunity. ""As policy and market demands shift, we must transform our supply chains just to keep up. Our customers, clients, investors and shareholders expect nothing less,"" said Danker, at the end of the first phase of the summit.""Every business has faced strategic challenges of this kind before. When the future attacks the present, the answer is never to protect the present. It is always to run to the future.""And as boardrooms around the world run the numbers, they are realising that the business case has shifted. To put it bluntly, in purely commercial terms, the cost of inaction is, for the first time, higher than the cost of action.""Clear and present dangerThe risks presented by insufficient action on climate and the knock-on impact of climate breakdown on economic, political and social stability - domestically and globally - have been made clear and, we must hope, intellectually understood at least by the leaders at Cop26. And now the opportunities presented by change have also been highlighted. Yet those few individuals with the authority to enact the change we know we need, those in the privileged position of having real power to do something meaningful on a global scale, appear to be engaged in endless rounds of compromise instead of leadership. There are mixed opinions on how effective Cop26 has been, with some environmental experts reporting surprise that it hasn't turned out quite as bad as they had expected. The latest draft of the agreement does still include the phasing out of fossil fuels which, Greenpeace points out, if the wording survives the final hours of the negotiations, would be the first time in 25 years of climate talks that language on reducing fossil fuels is included. Few dispute that not enough has been done and opportunities have missed though. The word sabotage has been more than once. But nobody at that table was sitting around stroking a white cat while plotting the downfall of mankind and everything else along with it. So what are we missing here? Because this year we even have proof that rapid, unilateral and broadly successful change is possible if the need is great enough. We have a powerful precedent for decisive but disruptive action in the face of existential threat in the form of the global response to Covid.The power of the status quo is certainly a force to be reckoned with, notes Jan P de Jonge, a business psychologist at People Business Psychology Ltd.National leaders are simply not going to experience the worst of climate change, unlike the younger people with stronger motivations""We suffer from unconsciously accepting the humdrum of repetitiveness and predictability. It's our psychological inertia to sleepwalk and sheepwalk into the growing problem of climate change when it doesn't yet affect us obviously and clearly.""Humans suffer from inaction. It takes a lot to change our behaviour, let alone take firm, decisive action that goes against the grain. Too many of the rules, norms and conventions that try to keep our society operating as it did yesterday are not sustainable and are doing our planet - and life on it - a huge disservice.""But the status quo, as Danker expressed in Glasgow, has already shifted. Our polling shows climate change is now a top concern among the British public and that they back strong action,"" says Lorraine Whitmarsh, professor of environmental psychology at the University of Bath and director of the Centre for Climate Change & Social Transformations. ""But the unprecedented levels of concern have only come about in the last three or four years. Before that, politicians were not hearing concerns about climate change from their constituents, there was no public mandate for action.""Historically there has also been the perception that the economy and climate protection are not compatible, that it is a luxury to address climate change and that those actions can be kicked down the road until we can afford it, even though it costs more to deal with the impact of climate change than to mitigate against it.""Whitmarsh is another expert who notes the presence of those very visible lobbyists as well as the age of the delegates.""National leaders are simply not going to experience the worst of climate change unlike the younger people with stronger motivations,"" she adds. ""Even if they have young members of their own family urging them on at home, when we're at work we all have to account to professional stakeholders.""Then there is the cruelly abstract nature of the problem.""Covid was very visible in the here and now. Everyone around us was being affected and we all toed the line and accepted the restrictions,"" Whitmarsh says. ""The psychological distance of climate change means competing priorities are always more pressing, allowing for the pragmatism that comes with leadership -climate change is not the only thing they are trying to address with limited funds.""Yes, with a step back we can see the compounded risks from climate change across every aspect of our society, but leaders don't have that mindset. They are focused on the issues of the day and the electoral cycle.""The political system is too short-term to allow the broader risks of climate change to directly translate into action.""Existential threatMeanwhile, psychologist Emma Kenny describes the polarised response to such existential threat on display - at all levels.""You can see total desensitization on one side and hypersensitization on the other,"" she says. ""Both are coping strategies and a response to being overloaded. It is easy to blame people when you feel powerless. It's not helpful to decide some of those people are good and some are bad when we are all feeling overloaded and powerless.""Leaders - those we perceive as having power in this - are turning up to a climate conference on one of 400 private jets, or not turning up at all. And yet we're teaching children to be terrified about the world ending and they are dreaming about drowning in their own bedrooms.""Of course politicians, balancing different aspects of what is important - economy, popularity and even their own mortality. Because of that, the urgency doesn't necessarily feel that relevant to them even though it seems so obvious to the rest of us. ""That's one of the big problems here, she adds. ""We think about our experience and what matters most and our protective mechanisms and it comes back to our own individual position - is the foreseeable future going to really affect me or my children and what is my capacity to change without it destroying me?""Those leaders are thriving in lots of contexts, and they're in a situation where they have been tasked to change the world dramatically in their lifetime. Some of them aren't on board, some of them don't believe it, some of them are on board but feel they have to balance the negotiations with other countries and with their other domestic, economic, and political demands.""Do they understand and believe the information they are getting? Are they perhaps so overwhelmed by what needs to change that they think it's an impossible dream?Which comes back to the question we have all been asking in the last two weeks - how far are those in positions of power really invested?Do they understand and believe the information they are getting? Are they perhaps so overwhelmed by what needs to change that they think it's an impossible dream?In high pressure circumstances, the people who thrive are those who believe that things can be changed and strive to achieve it, says Kenny""Unless you have that mindset, you can be totally overwhelmed.""The things we're talking about here, like carbon neutrality, aren't things that the people at the top or through the proletariat are invested in. It's too big.""One of the responses to that is to blame the public for a lack of change. The issue is that the public is exhausted. Who can focus on what Greta is saying when they can't afford to eat?""                     Positive possibility                   ""On the ground things are definitely changing,"" says Whitmarsh.""Announcements have been made and there has been a great deal of high profile campaigning. So much is happening to provide the sense that people are taking action on climate change and crucially, that action is now considered mainstream.""That was already happening a year ago, she says, with councils and businesses declaring climate emergencies, for example.""Some of the noise we're seeing at the moment is Cop specific and we might see that dying away but we are definitely seeing that climate is a core concern, and one that hasn't been dented by Covid 19 as it was during the financial crash, which is important,"" she adds.""We have reached a critical threshold now. The message about the need to make behavioural changes is accepted, the evidence is clear. That message is now ever present.""It isn't going away and we need to see government taking really concrete actions to facilitate low carbon strategies.""It seems surprisingly important that we can tap into the positives from Cop26 too.""Just flying into a room to have a few chats over several large, meat-based banquets is not demonstrating action and it's not demonstrating faith in the things they are saying,"" says Kenny.""If we don't believe it ourselves and we don't take action and nothing changes at any level of society.""But if our leaders can show us that they have faith and live that belief, the population will start to buy into it. If you look like you have your house in order, the people around you -the leaders at Cop26 or 27, or 29, and the electorate at home will start to believe it too.""Then we need the steps to start protecting the environment positively -the benefits, the upshots, the personal gains involved,"" she adds.""Let's stop talking about the world ending and start talking about helping the world to thrive - among our children in schools, in our homes and in the corridors of power.""When we are presented with a world of wonder and possibility we become protective, we become guardians. We become hopeful. We are empowered to genuine action, positive choice and results that really do change - and save the world.""It could be incredible.""

102,Cop26: Hundreds of academics denounce Glasgow summit as 'failure' and call for 'real green revolution',"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),News,856,"CLIMATE,NEWS;Version:3",856,England & Wales,Harry Cockburn,,,,Cop26: Hundreds of academics denounce Glasgow summit as 'failure' and call for 'real green revolution',"Over 200 academics have signed an open letter branding the UN's Cop26  climate summit in Glasgow a ""failure"" in which corporate interests are over-represented, and calling for a ""real green revolution "" to halt greenhouse gas emissions , regenerate nature, and adapt to the realities of the worsening climate crisis. Co-ordinated by former Extinction Rebellion  strategist Professor Rupert Read, of the University of East Anglia, along with Professor Jem Bendell of the University of Cumbria and Dr Malika Virah-Sawmy of IAAS-Potsdam, the letter claims that during the summit , ""business commitments distracted from the economic policies necessary to reduce atmospheric carbon and prepare for worsening disruption"".As well as pointing what they said was the failure of the summit to ""keep 1.5 alive,"" with insufficient commitments from governments to stop global average temperatures to rising 1.5C above what they were in the pre-industrial era, they describe the level of business interests represented at the summit as ""corporate capture"", which they say has critically undermined the conference.The letter , signed by doctors and professors from institutions including Harvard University, University of Edinburgh, University of Bordeaux, University of Barcelona, Tel Aviv University, and University of Auckland, among others,It says: ""We are hundreds of scholars from dozens of countries, who are grieving the situation but determined not to ignore it. We believe that the corporate capture and failure of Cop26 clearly show that people in communities and organisations must now lead our own emergency response. That includes coordinated radical policy advocacy from outside of a corporate-driven system, for a Real Green Revolution that will significantly reduce and drawdown emissions, regenerate nature and help us adapt.""The hot air from Glasgow means it's time for more honest and radical leadership. We must call out the fantasy that dangerous global heating will not get worse or that the largest corporations will come to our rescue. When we escape such delusion, we can contribute to a different way forward - one we hope governments will join when they escape the constraints of business-as-usual.""Speaking to The Independent, Professor Read said: ""I had very low expectations for Cop26 and what would happen on the official side of things, but things are even worse than I'd feared.""The terrible reality is that we're now heading for 2.7C of warming - this is the same as before. The 1.5C target is being abandoned, they just won't admit it.""We need a much larger mobilisation. People ought to be scared and angry and they ought to rise up immediately and slowly, like a wave, in response to the failure of this Cop.""The open letter comes after new analysis concluded  countries' short-term climate plans are still far off what is needed to meet the Paris Agreement's target of keeping global warming well below 2C.The research group Climate Action Tracker (CAT) said on Tuesday that nations' plans for slashing emissions by the end of this decade would result in 2.4C of heating by 2100. The analysis warned that, based on countries' practical policies alone, temperatures could reach 2.7C by 2100.Prof Read added: ""We need to look deep inside ourselves and think about what we are prepared to do and what we are prepared to put up with and not put up with. This is an unprecedented situation. It's horrifying and it's going to take its psychological toll on some people. Some people will really struggle with this, and rightly so, it's only rational that they do so.""The letter was organised through the Scholars' Warning Network, a group of academics who ""have broken the silence around potential societal collapse"", Prof Read said.Dr Virah-Sawmy, who is from Mauritius, and helped to organise the letter, said: ""I grieve that neither the climate revolution nor the participation revolution will happen in the intergovernmental sphere.""At a time of crisis, I am in pain that Cop26 is being felt by the global South as the least inclusive Cop.""Professor Bendell added: ""My colleagues in the corporate sustainability field need to say publicly what they know privately - which is that our economic system is at fault for the climate and ecological crisis, and whereas voluntary responses won't work sufficiently, they can distract us from challenging power.""Let's not be complicit in the lie that survival through reform is possible. Executives can keep improving their organisations, but not pretend that's the answer to our predicament. Instead we can join efforts towards a real green revolution. We can then open up to learning what kept us so cautious for so long, and learn from the people and knowledge we previously ignored.""

103,Final injection of 'can-do spirit' needed to get Cop26 deal over line - Sharma,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,standard.co.uk,News,779,"NEWS,UK;Version:1",779,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Emily Beament,,,,Final injection of 'can-do spirit' needed to get Cop26 deal over line - Sharma,"Alok Sharma  has called on countries for a ""final injection of that can-do spirit"" they have had at Cop26 to get a deal in Glasgow  over the line.The Cop26 President  was speaking after a new draft of the overarching deal that could be agreed at the Cop26 climate talks was published on Friday morning.The latest version of the ""cover decision"" has weakened language on fossil fuels but has kept them in the text, added more on finance for poorer countries to adapt with climate change, and included a request for all nations to strengthen their plans for cutting emissions up to 2030 by the end of next year.There are also drafts to finalise the ""Paris  rulebook"", including on creating carbon markets and delivering transparency to help assess what countries are doing, to make the Paris climate accord operational and effective.Addressing the climate summit on Friday afternoon, Mr Sharma said: ""This is our collective moment in history, this is our chance to forge a cleaner, healthier, more prosperous world.""This is our time to deliver on the high ambition set by our leaders at the start of this summit. We must rise to the occasion.""Mr Sharma said that despite ""extensive discussions"", some key disagreements remained over the Cop26 draft as he called for ""pragmatic and workable solutions"".Addressing an informal stocktaking plenary, he said: ""We have come a long way over the past two weeks and now we need that final injection of that can-do spirit which is present at this Cop so that we get this shared endeavour over the line.""In the plenary, countries lined up to express their views, including calls to keep the target of limiting global warming 1.5C within reach and more ambitious action from big emitters, a stronger push from phasing out coal and subsidies for fossil fuels, and finance for poor nations.In the Paris Agreement in 2015, countries committed to limit temperature rises to ""well below"" 2C and try to limit them to 1.5C - beyond which the worst impacts of climate change will be felt.                     ""I encourage you to consider the choices that we must make, and the trust vested in you by billions.""This was the message of @PEspinosaC  when #COP26  opened 2 weeks ago.On the final day of the conference, head to our live blog & top news for updates  https://t.co/eARTV5OaG1 pic.twitter.com/iLVbcijcC4 - UN Climate Change (@UNFCCC) November 12, 2021Scientists have warned that keeping temperature rises to 1.5C requires global emissions to be cut by 45% by 2030, and to zero overall by mid-century.But despite countries being required to update their action plans, known as nationally determined contributions, for emissions cuts up to 2030 in the run-up to Glasgow, the latest pledges leave the world well off track to meet the goal.Therefore, countries are under pressure to come up with a deal in Glasgow that will see them rapidly increase their ambition for emission cuts in the 2020s to stop the 1.5C goal slipping out of reach.It's clear that the aim of this summit to keep 1.5 alive is in mortal perilEd Miliband, shadow business secretaryThe new version of the text ""requests"" countries to revisit and strengthen their plans for 2030 within the next year in line with the Paris temperature goal.This compares with the previous version which ""urges"" them to do so, in what is a strengthening of the language by making it more of a direction.Mr Sharma has been clear there are no efforts to renegotiate the Paris Agreement - which means that both the ""well below"" 2C and 1.5C targets are still both included in the Paris goal - though he has also said a key aim of Glasgow is about keeping the 1.5C goal within reach.In the wake of the new draft, shadow business secretary Ed Miliband  warned the 1.5C goal ""was in mortal peril"", and called for the UK to force the pace over the next year to talks in Egypt in 2022.He also said it was crucial developed countries deliver the long-promised 100 billion US dollars a year for poorer countries to cope with climate change, which was pledged for 2020 but has been delayed until at least 2022, to build an alliance between vulnerable and developed countries to boost action.Providing finance for developing countries to develop cleanly, adapt to the impacts of climate change and address the loss and damage to people, livelihoods, land and infrastructure already being hit by increasing weather extremes and rising seas is also key to securing a deal in Glasgow.

We saw in London the consequences of flash flooding in summer, the Tube being closed down and homes being flooded. We saw the floods in New York, Germany and wildfires in Greece.""I'm hoping in the last few hours everyone redoubles their efforts.""His comments come as UK minister and Cop president Alok Sharma warned that negotiators still face a ""monumental challenge""  in reaching consensus on key issues before the summit's scheduled finish time on Friday.""Whilst we have made progress, we are not there yet on the most crucial issues,"" he said. ""Time is running out.""How to include the need to drastically move away from fossil fuels in the final Glasgow text is reported to be a key sticking point for countries hammering out a deal.On Thursday, a small group of countries led by Denmark and Costa Rica  announced that they would forge a path to ending new oil and gas production, a step scientists say will be crucial to meeting global climate goals.However, the UK government, which is hosting the Glasgow summit, said it would not join the international alliance aimed at moving away from fossil fuels.Mr Khan said that the UK's decision to snub the agreement showed a lack of leadership. ""We should be leading by example,"" he said.The mayor today attended a meeting with UN chief Antonio Guterres and other city leaders to mark ""cities day"" at Cop26.Last week, he was elected the new chair of C40 cities, a group of 97 city mayors from across the world aiming to take action on the climate crisis.He said that he believed cities could take the lead on tackling the climate crisis where national governments had fallen behind.""More than two-thirds of the C40 cities are either on course to meet the promises made at Paris or have exceeded that,"" he said.""That's versus the only country I could find that's meeting the Paris Agreement and that's the Gambia.""He added that he was still hopeful that nations could make positive progress to address the climate crisis at Cop26.""The key thing that needs to come out of this Cop is optimism,"" he said.""If pessimism or defeat comes out of this, that doesn't bode well for national governments or for the sectors, businesses or mayors.

105,Wasted opportunity: Why isn't excess food higher on Cop26 agenda?,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),News,829,"CLIMATE,NEWS;Version:1",829,England & Wales,Sally Webb,,,,Wasted opportunity: Why isn't excess food higher on Cop26 agenda?,"A food charity is calling on politicians, food producers and consumers to tackle food waste if they are serious about confronting climate change.If food waste were a country, it would be the third-largest emitter of carbon globally, yet the issue has been largely ignored in climate discussions at Cop26, according to food charity FareShare.James Persad, Head of Marketing and Engagement at FareShare, said: ""Even if you take all the other big emitters out of the picture, food production alone would push the earth past 1.5 degrees of warming - yet food waste has effectively been frozen out of talks at Cop26.""Food is extraordinarily resource-intensive to produce - which is why it's heartbreaking to see so much of it being wasted - with all the energy and water used to create it wasted too.""Considering the environmental impact of food waste, why does it not grab people's attention in the same way as issues like emissions and ocean pollution?""The honest answer is I just don't know,"" Mr Persad admits. ""I don't know if it's because food is taken for granted.""In the UK, food waste accounts for between 6 and 7 per cent of total greenhouse gas emissions, with an estimated two million tonnes of perfectly edible food needlessly wasted on UK farms and in factories every year, instead of being sent to charities and community groups.""It's a big and thorny issue and we are astonished it hasn't been addressed more formally at Cop26.""While consumers can take steps to reduce food waste and vote with their wallets to pressure food producers with high levels of waste, James says the government must do more to incentivise food redistribution.He praised plans to ask big food producers to publish food waste data from 2023 onwards and hopes that transparency will force them to find ways to become more efficient.Mr Persad added: ""A key barrier is cost. To keep food safe for human distribution is that bit much more than any other option because you need to store it safely and take temperature checks. We want to see food businesses and the government contribute towards these costs.""Meaningful action on food waste will be crucial if we are to achieve Net Zero. We're calling on government to take this issue seriously and commit to fair funding to enable food businesses do the right thing, morally and environmentally, with their surplus food.""It is proven that getting food to people is the most environmentally-friendly option.""The charity released new data on Friday from The Carbon Trust, showing that for every one tonne of edible food redistributed to people instead of being wasted, 1.6 tonnes of embedded CO2 equivalent within that food will not have been emitted in vain.The independent research quantifies, for the first time, the 'hidden' carbon embedded within the life cycle of the food FareShare redistributes, arising from the energy used in everything from cultivation and harvesting to packaging and transportation.The research also finds that, for every tonne of food sent to charities, the needless loss of 1,525,000 litres of water needed to produce that food will also be avoided.Last year FareShare redistributed over 35,000 tonnes of surplus food, avoiding the waste of over 53bn litres of water - more than the combined annual water usage of everyone in the cities of Birmingham and Coventry.FareShare is the UK's biggest food charity. It takes surplus good-to-eat food from the food industry, sorts it in one of its 30 regional warehouses, and passes it onto a network of more than 10,500 charities and charity groups, including food banks, hostels, refuges, pantries, community centres, older people's lunch clubs and breakfast and after school clubs for children.                     The Independent, in partnership with sister title Evening Standard, raised more than £10m to feed the nation's poorest  and most vulnerable people during the Covid  crisis.The Help the Hungry  appeal supplied more than 20 million meals during the pandemic. The campaign saw both titles partner with The Felix Project, a charity redistributing surplus food collected from supermarkets and restaurants to those in dire need of help.And writing yesterday in The Independent, Ban Ki-moon, a former secretary-general of the United Nations, outlined how food and farming are both a driver of and a solution to the climate crisis.The 77-year-old humanitarian states that unless we change how we currently produce, process, transport, consume and discard food, we will not make any headway on climate change  mitigation and adaptation, what he calls the ""defining issue of our time"".

106,Cop26: Latest draft agreement weaker on need to phase out fossil fuels as summit enters final day,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),News,757,"CLIMATE,NEWS;Version:8",757,England & Wales,Daisy Dunne and Louise Boyle,,,,Cop26: Latest draft agreement weaker on need to phase out fossil fuels as summit enters final day,"A new draft of the final deal that could emerge from the Cop26  climate summit appears to have watered down its call to curb fossil fuels , but did not remove all mention of the need for their phase out as some watchers had feared.The first draft  of the potential Glasgow pact released on Wednesday called for countries ""to accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels"".Published in the early hours of Friday morning, the new draft  instead calls for ""accelerating the phaseout of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels"".The texts from Glasgow are the first UN climate papers to make a specific mention of fossil fuels. Some observers had suggested that they would not survive the rounds of intense negotiations between the 197 countries.Friday is the final scheduled day of the UN climate summit in Glasgow, where nations have gathered aiming to keep alive hopes of limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels by 2100.Meeting the 1.5C target, the aspiration of the landmark Paris Agreement, is vital to stemming further climate impacts across the globe.The first draft of the final agreement from Cop26 ""urged"" all countries to ""revisit and strengthen"" their climate pledges for 2030 in order to give the world a better chance at keeping temperatures at 1.5C. It came after a stark analysis  published on Tuesday warned that even when pledges agreed at the Glasgow summit are taken into consideration, global greenhouse as emissions in 2030 are likely to be twice as high as what would be needed to meet the 1.5C target. However, the latest draft uses different language in its call for countries to up their 2030 pledges.Instead of ""urging"" countries to submit tougher plans, it ""requests"" that they do. It is currently not clear whether this change represents a strengthening or weakening of the text. According to the UNFCCC style guide , ""requests"" is a stronger word than ""urges"".A new mention of ""methane"" has made it into the latest draft of the Glasgow pact. The new text asks countries to ""consider further actions"" to reduce non-CO2 greenhouse gases this decade, with specific mention of the potent polluter methane.The opening statement of the Glasgow pact now also makes specific reference to the role of children in demanding that leaders take action.The new draft has strengthened wording and provided a specific timeline on increased climate finance, one of the key demands of developing countries and small island states who are already facing severe and worsening impacts.The text now ""urges"" developed countries to ""at least double"" climate finance for developing countries by 2025.The draft now also acknowledges ""with deep regret"" that developed countries have failed to meet promises first made in 2009 to provide $100 billion per year to help poorer nations to help them slash their emissions and adapt to worsening climate impacts.The acknowledgement of wealthy nations' failure to meet the $100bn had been ""a specific ask of poor countries"", according to Mohamed Adow , director of the energy and climate think tank Power Shift Africa.Jennifer Morgan, executive director of Greenpeace International, said the latest draft text ""could be better"" but there were elements ""worth holding on to"".""The key line on phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies has been critically weakened, but it's still there and needs to be strengthened again before this summit closes. That's going to be a big tussle and one we need to win,"" she said.""But there's wording in here worth holding on to and the UK Presidency needs to fight tooth and nail to keep the most ambitious elements in the deal.""We've moved from richer nations largely ignoring the pleas of developing countries for promised finance to tackle climate change, to the beginnings of a recognition that their calls should be met. Now we need developed countries to scale up their offer of support and finance.""Dr Jennifer Allan, a lecturer in international relations at Cardiff University, added that the new draft  was, on the whole, ""a lot more balanced between the views of developed and developing countries"".

Last night the three main architects of the Paris agreement told the Guardian that it is essential that countries return next year  if catastrophic global heating is to be averted.Here are the key quotes: Christiana Figueres : ""If that [five years] is the first time that countries are called to increase their ambitions, honestly that's going to be too late. This is critically important. We need much more urgency, as this is the critical decade. We need to come back next year. We can't wait five years for new NDCs."" Laurence Tubiana : ""It's really important that we come back next year, and in 2023. That must be central to any outcome in Glasgow. This is necessary to fulfil the Paris agreement."" Laurent Fabius : ""In the present circumstances [targets] must be enhanced next year.""

Under the Paris agreement countries are expected to return every five years, but scientists and diplomats say new science has shown that is far too slow and that without better pledges before 2025, the world would be heading for disaster.The text of the first draft said:29. Urges Parties that have not yet submitted new or updated nationally determined contributions in accordance with decision 1/CP.21, paragraphs 23-24 to do so as soon as possible in advance of the twenty-seventh session of the Conference of the Parties (November 2022);while the new text says:29. Recalls Articles 3 and 4, paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 11, of the Paris Agreement and requests Parties to revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their nationally determined contributions as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022, taking into account different national circumstances;The caveat ""taking into account different national circumstances"" is doing a lot of heavy lifting - it's not hard to imagine almost any country could find an excuse to lean on that if they chose to.block-time updated-timeUpdated at 8.22am GMTblock-time published-time 8.04am GMT Simon Evans at Carbon Brief makes the point that the mention of fossil fuel and coal phaseouts is still in the text.

Notes with deep regret that the goal of developed country Parties to mobilize jointly USD 100 billion per year by 2020 in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation has not yet been met, and welcomes the increased pledges made by many developed country Parties and the Climate Finance Delivery Plan: Meeting the US$100 Billion Goal and the collective actions contained therein;Reaching the target of $100bn a year - which had been promised in 2015 as part of the Paris agreement - is a key sticking point of the negotiations and one of the main things poor and vulnerable countries are demanding. This acknowledgement that rich countries have broken their promise appears to mark progress on the issue.block-time published-time 7.47am GMT The Associated Press news agency's initial reaction is downbeat, suggesting the wording on fossil fuels has been weakened.Negotiators at this year's UN climate talks in Glasgow appeared to be backing away from a call to end all use of coal and phase out fossil fuel subsidies completely.The latest draft proposal from the meeting's chair released Friday calls on countries to accelerate ""the phaseout of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels.""A previous version [on] Wednesday had called on countries to ""accelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuel.""While the chair's proposal is likely to undergo further negotiation at the talks, due to end Friday, the change in wording suggested a shift away from unconditional demands that some fossil fuel exporting nations have objected to.block-time published-time 7.45am GMT Paragraph three of the draft has changed. The first draft read:3. Expresses alarm and concern that human activities have caused around 1.1 °C of warming to date, that impacts are already being felt in every region, and that the carbon budget consistent with achieving the Paris Agreement temperature goal is being rapidly depleted;but the new draft says: 3. Expresses alarm and utmost concern that human activities have caused around 1.1 °C of global warming to date and that impacts are already being felt in every region;The removal of the reference to the carbon budget being depleted feels like a weakening of the text, though it's possible that language has been removed in exchange for strengthening of language elsewhere during the horse trading between negotiators.block-time published-time 7.38am GMT  Second draft of Cop26 text published  Here's a link  to the draft text which appeared on the UN website minutes ago.

108,Cop26: What is in the latest draft of the Glasgow climate change agreement?,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),News,551,CLIMATE;Version:2,551,England & Wales,Andrew Woodcock,,,,Cop26: What is in the latest draft of the Glasgow climate change agreement?,"The United Nations Cop26  summit in Glasgow is seen as humanity's last best chance of reining in global warming to below 1.5C above pre-industrial levels -viewed by experts as essential to avoid catastrophic climate change. But as the two-week summit enters its final day, there are fears that the agreement due to be sealed on Friday will not go far enough.So what is in the latest draft of the proposed agreement, released by the Cop26 presidency led by UK minister Alok Sharma at 7.14am after negotiations lasting late into the night? The document voices ""alarm and utmost concern"" that human activities have already caused around 1.1C of global warming and stresses the urgency of stepping up humanity's response in ""this critical decade"" to 2030. It reaffirms the goal of the Paris Agreement of 2015 to keep warming ""well below"" 2C and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5C -requiring ""rapid, deep, and sustained"" reductions of 45 per cent in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and net-zero ""around mid-century"". It calls on the near-200 countries represented at Glasgow to report back on progress towards more ambitious action at next year's Cop27 summit in Egypt.  However, there is no legal requirement on them to act. Instead, they are ""requested""to do so, which UN lawyers regard as being stronger than being ""urged"", as an earlier draft on Wednesday did. The document voices concern that rich world support for developing countries particularly vulnerable to climate change remains ""insufficient"". It urges developed countries urgently to scale up their financial and technical support to help poorer states adapt, going ""significantly"" beyond the 2020 target of $100 billion annually -already set to be missed by three years. Crucially, the new draft maintains a commitment on fossil fuel use, despite efforts by oil and gas producing countries like Saudi Arabia to remove it from the text. However there are concerns that the promise in an earlier version to ""accelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuel"" has been watered down. The text now includes a commitment to accelerate ""the phase-out of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels"". Nations around the world are also called upon to ""rapidly scale up clean power generation"". For the first time, the draft calls on states to consider action to cut non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases , such as methane.  This follows the focus on methane in Wednesday's US/China declaration on bilateral co-operation in the battle against climate change. Forests and other natural ecosystems capable of acting as carbon sinks should be ""protected, conserved and restored"", the draft says. It calls on rich-world nations urgently to scale up financial, technical and capacity-building support for developing countries to deal with the loss and damage done to their societies by rising temperatures.

111,New draft of Cop26 deal weakens language on fossil fuel phaseout,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,standard.co.uk,News,700,"NEWS,UK;Version:11",700,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Emily Beament,,,,New draft of Cop26 deal weakens language on fossil fuel phaseout,"A new draft of the deal that could be agreed at the Glasgow Cop26 climate talks appears to have watered down its push to curb fossil fuels.The first draft of the ""cover decision"" for the overarching agreement at the summit called for countries ""to accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels"".In a new draft produced on Friday morning, that has changed to calling on countries to accelerate the shift to clean energy systems, ""including by rapidly scaling up clean power generation and accelerating the phaseout of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels"".The inclusion of a reference to fossil fuels was a first for a UN decision document of this type but was expected to get fierce pushback from some countries - and still may not survive to the final text.Talks went on through the night and look set to overrun from their finish time of Friday evening as negotiators come under pressure to resolve issues around finance for poor countries,fossil fuels, the efforts of countries to cut emissions in the 2020s and rules on carbon markets and transparency.The latest draft appears to have strengthened language on getting countries to ""revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets"" in their national action plans by the end of 2022 to align with global goals to limit temperature rises to ""well below"" 2C and try to limit them to 1.5C.The new version ""requests"" countries do so, compared to the previous version which ""urges"" them to do so.Michael Jacobs, former climate adviser to Gordon Brown  and veteran of Cop talks, said UK, EU and UNFCCC lawyers were saying that ""requests"" was stronger language than ""urges"".He said: ""I see this as a strengthening of the language which effectively means countries are being told to come back next year with nationally determined contributions aligned to the 1.5C temperature goal.""However, David Waskow, international climate director of the World Resources Institute (WRI) think tank, said the move from ""urges"" to ""requests"" is ""in international legal terms a weakening"".His view was echoed by his colleague Helen Mountford, WRI vice-president for climate and economics.But she said: ""Overall, on balance this is definitely a stronger and more balanced text than we had a few days ago.""She said sections on adaptation finance and loss and damage appear stronger but the reference to ""inefficient"" fossil fuel subsidies ""does weaken that a little"".She said a gap remains on the pledge from developed nations to mobilise one billion US dollars a year from 2020, with no reference to making up the current shortfall.                     Earth is sending a message that we must not ignore. And we all have a vital role to play.Watch the full @EarthToCop  film that was shown to world leaders at the #COP26  Opening Ceremony https://t.co/OSdizk1KgE #TogetherForOurPlanet  | #ClimateAction - COP26 (@COP26) November 12, 2021Scientists have warned that keeping temperature rises to 1.5C - beyond which the worst impacts of climate change will be felt - requires global emissions to be cut by 45% by 2030, and to zero overall by mid-century.But current action plans known as nationally determined contributions for emissions cuts up to 2030 leave the world well off track to meet the goal, and could see warming of 2.4C over the long term.So countries are under pressure to rapidly increase their ambition for emission cuts in the 2020s to stop the 1.5C goal slipping out of reach.There is now a date - missing from the first draft - for when developed countries should double the provision of finance to help developing countries adapt to climate change - by 2025.Providing finance for developing countries to develop cleanly, adapt to the impacts of climate change and address the loss and damage to people, livelihoods, land and infrastructure already being hit by increasing weather extremes and rising seas is also key to securing a deal in Glasgow.Helen Mountford, Vice President  Climate and Economics Read MoreActivists hold 'People's Plenary' in Cop26 hall as protests expected outsideIn the second week of COP26, the mood turned darkWeaker fossil fuel language, but more on finance in latest draft of Cop26 deal",Copyright 2021 Evening Standard Limited All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper; Web Publication|WEBES|ENGLISH|AGREEMENTSCLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION & POLICYEMISSIONSEUROPEAN UNIONUNITED NATIONSINTERNATIONAL LAWECONOMIC NEWS|ENERGY & UTILITIESCOAL FIRED PLANTSEMISSIONSALTERNATIVE & RENEWABLE ENERGYELECTRIC POWER PLANTS|GORDON BROWN|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|UNITED STATES",
112,"UK's biggest carbon emitter Drax 'greenwashing' wood-fired power at Cop26, campaigners say","November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),News,694,"CLIMATE,NEWS;Version:2",694,England & Wales,Harry Cockburn,,DRAX GROUP PLC,DRAX GROUP PLC,"UK's biggest carbon emitter Drax 'greenwashing' wood-fired power at Cop26, campaigners say","Campaigners at Cop26  have accused energy giant Drax , which runs the biggest wood-burning power station in the world at its North Yorkshire premises, of ""greenwashing "" the practice of burning wood pellets for energy, calling for an end to this method of power generation.Following protests at the Glasgow summit outside an event at which Drax representatives were speaking, campaigners carrying banners described Drax's claims of ""sustainable wood burning"" as ""greenwash"", which undermines the core aim of the conference.The protests come days after Drax was dropped from an index of green energy firms amid growing concern within the financial sector over the sustainability of its wood-burning power plant.The company was previously one of the largest coal-users in Europe for the power station, but by 2016 had been converted to run entirely on wood pellets which Drax says  are made using wood unsuitable for other industries, and emit 80 per cent less CO2 emissions than coal.Nonetheless, the firm's power station in Yorkshire remains the UK's single biggest carbon emitter, releasing over 13 million tonnes of CO2 from burning wood last year, and using around 7 million tonnes of wood pellets every year - the equivalent of about 25 million trees, scientists have said.This is more wood than the entire forestry output of Britain.In the UK, over £1bn in renewable electricity subsidies go to burning wood in power stations every year, of which £832 million went to Drax in 2020, according to figures from Drax's 2020 Annual Report. But there is now growing dissent over support for burning biomass for electricity, which critics have said can harm the climate and biodiversity.Meanwhile, local activists in regions where woody biomass is sourced are raising the alarm over the loss of their forests and the industry's impact on local air and water quality, according to environmental organisation BiofuelWatch.Sally Clark from the NGO said: ""Drax relies on public money which should instead be funding a just transition to cleaner energy for all of us. Drax was fined a record $2.5m (£1.9m) for air quality breaches at its Mississippi pellet plant this February, this figure is roughly equivalent to the £2.27m Drax is handed by the UK government every single day.""It's outrageous that the world's biggest tree burner, Drax, and the world's largest wood pellet producer, Enviva, are playing a prominent role at Cop26 events while communities who are most impacted by Drax's forest destruction are shut out of the climate summit. Our forests and our climate are under threat from policies which should be supporting renewable energy but which are instead benefiting big polluters like Drax.""A Drax spokesperson told The Independent: ""The climate crisis is the greatest challenge facing our planet and the UK government's recently published Net Zero Strategy makes very clear the critical role that biomass will play in both reducing emissions as well as removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This is also the view of the world's leading climate scientists at the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.""Drax's biomass meets the highest sustainability standards, and these ensure that we do not use biomass that causes deforestation, forest decline or carbon debt. This is a fundamental commitment in our world-leading sustainable biomass sourcing policy.""Converting Drax Power Station to use sustainable biomass instead of coal transformed the business into Europe's biggest decarbonisation project and has helped Britain decarbonise its electricity system at a faster rate than any other major economy. We have reduced our emissions by more than 90 per cent in the last decade and Drax is now one of Europe's lowest carbon energy generators.""

113,"Compromise in the face of global disaster at Cop26;We are still miles off the limits set by the Paris Agreement to avoid 'catastrophic' climate change, writes Kate Hughes","November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),News,2236,SECTION 2;Pg. 34,2236,England & Wales,KATE HUGHES,,,,"Compromise in the face of global disaster at Cop26We are still miles off the limits set by the Paris Agreement to avoid 'catastrophic' climate change, writes Kate Hughes","This, we were reminded endlessly in the weeks leading up to the UN climate conference in Glasgow, was our last chance. The build-up to Cop26, against a backdrop of increasingly extreme weather and barely a whisper on the subject at the G20 meeting that preceded it, was gloomy, bordering on fatalistic.Even before it started, and in the face of multiple unmistakable warnings of imminent and widespread environmental collapse, the Glasgow meeting was written off as hopeless, pointless and scarily weak on both the delivery of previous commitments and a consensus over the need for new, stronger ones.It didn't help that major and powerful polluters didn't turn up at all and or that others reneged on their pledges within hours - such as Indonesia over the apparent all-star, big win for the planet - the ""agreement"" to end deforestation by 2030.India pledged to achieve carbon neutrality, but only by 2070, and Saudi Arabia's contingent pushed hard to wipe out the ""keep 1.5 alive"" message altogether.Nor, because it didn't even make it onto the conference timetable, was there any kind of a consensus on reducing the impact of the global meat and dairy industry. And yet, if left unchecked, the forecasted growth in that industry could mean that by 2050, the livestock sector could account for 80 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas 'budget'.Meanwhile, anxious and desperate campaigners, many of them children, demonstrated outside the centre and in cities around the world, prevented from being able to look those leaders - described more than once in the last fortnight as stale, male and pale - in the eye as time after time they drew a line through actions that could have secured a stable future. Again.Blah blah blahThe rhetoric started strong. The grandiose statements at the beginning of last week came thick and fast as leader after leader got up to urge everyone else in the room to step up, to follow them into battle. But somehow they still failed to reach sufficient consensus to make changes to stop the rot that is already undermining economic and therefore their own political strength around the world.Even if the pledges thrashed out in Glasgow had held for more than a few hours and the people doing the real work in the background - most of whom are still pulling all-nighters in the Scottish city to get some strategic meat on the bones and somehow deliver on the promises made - it won't be nearly good enough.We are still miles off the limits set in Paris to avoid ""catastrophic"" climate change. Research group the Climate Action Tracker has calculated that the nations' current plans for emissions reductions by the end of this decade will still result in 2.4C of heating by the end of the century.Take into account the plans that were thrashed out at Cop and within nine years we will be collectively pumping out greenhouse gases that are twice the amount that would meet the 1.5C Paris Agreement aspiration.It makes frustratingly little sense to the billions of us who didn't attend the event. We sit at assume, assuming glumly that they were weighed down by the scale of the problem, by the bottom line, or by lobbyists peddling short-term economic and political positions, such as the massive fossil fuel contingent whose number eclipsed that of any single nation in attendance.Maybe they also missed the presentation by the CBI's director general Tony Danker, who reminded the gathering - which this year included a record number of CEOs - that net zero is no longer about reputation, it is about commercial opportunity.""As policy and market demands shift, we must transform our supply chains just to keep up. Our customers, clients, investors and shareholders expect nothing less,"" said Danker, at the end of the first phase of the summit.""Every business has faced strategic challenges of this kind before. When the future attacks the present, the answer is never to protect the present. It is always to run to the future.""And as boardrooms around the world run the numbers, they are realising that the business case has shifted. To put it bluntly, in purely commercial terms, the cost of inaction is, for the first time, higher than the cost of action.""Clear and present dangerThe risks presented by insufficient action on climate and the knock-on impact of climate breakdown on economic, political and social stability - domestically and globally - have been made clear and, we must hope, intellectually understood at least by the leaders at Cop26. And now the opportunities presented by change have also been highlighted.Yet those few individuals with the authority to enact the change we know we need, those in the privileged position of having real power to do something meaningful on a global scale, appear to be engaged in endless rounds of compromise instead of leadership.There are mixed opinions on how effective Cop26 has been, with some environmental experts reporting surprise that it hasn't turned out quite as bad as they had expected. The latest draft of the agreement does still include the phasing out of fossil fuels which, Greenpeace points out, if the wording survives the final hours of the negotiations, would be the first time in 25 years of climate talks that language on reducing fossil fuels is included.Few dispute that not enough has been done and opportunities have missed, though. The word sabotage has been more than once. But nobody at that table was sitting around stroking a white cat while plotting the downfall of mankind and everything else along with it.So what are we missing here? Because this year we even have proof that rapid, unilateral and broadly successful change is possible if the need is great enough. We have a powerful precedent for decisive but disruptive action in the face of existential threat in the form of the global response to Covid. The power of the status quo is certainly a force to be reckoned with, notes Jan P de Jonge, a business psychologist at People Business Psychology Ltd.""We suffer from unconsciously accepting the humdrum of repetitiveness and predictability. It's our psychological inertia to sleepwalk and sheepwalk into the growing problem of climate change when it doesn't yet affect us obviously and clearly. Humans suffer from inaction. It takes a lot to change our behaviour, let alone take firm, decisive action that goes against the grain.""Too many of the rules, norms and conventions that try to keep our society operating as it did yesterday are not sustainable and are doing our planet - and life on it - a huge disservice. But the status quo, as Danker expressed in Glasgow, has already shifted. Our polling shows climate change is now a top concern among the British public and that they back strong action,"" says Lorraine Whitmarsh, professor of environmental psychology at the University of Bath and director of the Centre for Climate Change & Social Transformations.""But the unprecedented levels of concern have only come about in the last three or four years. Before that, politicians were not hearing concerns about climate change from their constituents, there was no public mandate for action. Historically there has also been the perception that the economy and climate protection are not compatible, that it is a luxury to address climate change and that those actions can be kicked down the road until we can afford it, even though it costs more to deal with the impact of climate change than to mitigate against it.""Whitmarsh is another expert who notes the presence of those very visible lobbyists as well as the age of the delegates. ""National leaders are simply not going to experience the worst of climate change unlike the younger people with stronger motivations,"" she adds. ""Even if they have young members of their own family urging them on at home, when we're at work we all have to account to professional stakeholders.Then there is the cruelly abstract nature of the problem. ""Covid was very visible in the here and now. Everyone around us was being affected and we all toed the line and accepted the restrictions,"" Whitmarsh says. ""The psychological distance of climate change means competing priorities are always more pressing, allowing for the pragmatism that comes with leadership - climate change is not the only thing they are trying to address with limited funds.""Yes, with a step back we can see the compounded risks from climate change across every aspect of our society, but leaders don't have that mindset. They are focused on the issues of the day and the electoral cycle. The political system is too short-term to allow the broader risks of climate change to directly translate into action.""Existential threatMeanwhile, psychologist Emma Kenny describes the polarised response to such existential threat on display - at all levels.""You can see total desensitization on one side and hypersensitization on the other,"" she says. ""Both are coping strategies and a response to being overloaded. It is easy to blame people when you feel powerless. It's not helpful to decide some of those people are good and some are bad when we are all feeling overloaded and powerless.""Leaders - those we perceive as having power in this - turning up to a climate conference with 85 cars, or on one of 400 private jets, or not turning up at all - and yet we're teaching children to be terrified about the world ending and they are dreaming about drowning in their own bedrooms.""Of course politicians, balancing different aspects of what is important - economy, popularity and even their own mortality. Because of that, the urgency doesn't necessarily feel that relevant to them even though it seems so obvious to the rest of us.""That's one of the big problems here, she adds. ""We think about our experience and what matters most and our protective mechanisms and it comes back to our own individual position - is the foreseeable future going to really affect me or my children and what is my capacity to change without it destroying me?""Those leaders are thriving in lots of contexts, and they're in a situation where they have been tasked to change the world dramatically in their lifetime. Some of them aren't on board, some of them don't believe it, some of them are on board but feel they have to balance the negotiations with other countries and with their other domestic, economic, and political demands.""Which comes back to the question we have all been asking in the last two weeks - how far are those in positions of power really invested? Do they understand and believe the information they are getting? Are they perhaps so overwhelmed by what needs to change that they think it's an impossible dream?In high-pressure circumstances, the people who thrive are those who believe that things can be changed and strive to achieve it, says Kenny""Unless you have that mindset, you can be totally overwhelmed. The things we're talking about here, like carbon neutrality, aren't things that the people at the top or through the proletariat are invested in. It's too big. One of the responses to that is to blame the public for a lack of change. The issue is that the public is exhausted. Who can focus on what Greta is saying when they can't afford to eat?""Positive possibility""On the ground things are definitely changing,"" says Whitmarsh. ""Announcements have been made and there has been a great deal of high profile campaigning. So much is happening to provide the sense that people are taking action on climate change and crucially, that action is now considered mainstream.""That was already happening a year ago, she says, with councils and businesses declaring climate emergencies, for example.""Some of the noise we're seeing at the moment is Cop specific and we might see that dying away but we are definitely seeing that climate is a core concern, and one that hasn't been dented by Covid 19 as it was during the financial crash, which is important,"" she adds.""We have reached a critical threshold now. The message about the need to make behavioural changes is accepted, the evidence is clear. That message is now ever-present. It isn't going away and we need to see government taking really concrete actions to facilitate low carbon strategies.""It seems surprisingly important that we can tap into the positives from Cop26 too.""Just flying into a room to have a few chats over several large, meat-based banquets is not demonstrating action and it's not demonstrating faith in the things they are saying,"" says Kenny. ""If we don't believe it ourselves and we don't take action and nothing changes at any level of society.""But if our leaders can show us that they have faith and live that belief, the population will start to buy into it. If you look like you have your house in order, the people around you - the leaders at Cop26 or 27, or 29, and the electorate at home will start to believe it too.""Then we need the steps to start protecting the environment positively - the benefits, the upshots, the personal gains involved,"" she adds. ""Let's stop talking about the world ending and start talking about helping the world to thrive - among our children in schools, in our homes and in the corridors of power.""When we are presented with a world of wonder and possibility we become protective, we become guardians. We become hopeful. We are empowered to genuine action, positive choice and results that really do change - and save the world.

117,Mounting pressure on EU to get Cop26 deal over the line;UN chief Guterres warns 'emissions gap remains a devastating threat',"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Irish Times,News,565,FRONT PAGE;Pg. 1,565,Ireland,Kevin O'Sullivan and Denis Staunton,,,,Mounting pressure on EU to get Cop26 deal over the lineUN chief Guterres warns 'emissions gap remains a devastating threat',"DENIS STAUNTON  The Cop26 summit is facing into tortuous final hours as negotiators attempt to strengthen a declaration and add greater urgency in the global response to the climate crisis - with most pressure on the EU to get it across the line.UN secretary general António Guterres attempted to push negotiators to a more ambitious outcome, while Cop26 president Alok Sharma warned time was running out, adding ""the window on keeping 1.5 [degrees] within reach is closing"".With 197 countries locked in negotiations in Glasgow over a second version of a draft agreement, a flurry of small protests were staged inside the Cop26 venue, at its periphery and throughout the city. Activists deflated the tyres of about 60 4X4s in the city's west end in protest at the cars' high levels of emissions.Announcements made in Glasgow ""on forests, methane, clean technology and more"" were encouraging, Mr Guterres said.Coal plants ""But they are far from enough. The emissions gap remains a devastating threat. The finance and adaptation gap represents a glaring injustice for the developing world. Promises ring hollow when the fossil-fuels industry still receives trillions as measured by the IMF,"" he added, ""or when countries are still building coal plants. Governments need to pick up the pace and show the necessary ambition - we cannot settle for the lowest common denominator."" If the EU does not lead and build the high-ambition coalition needed, no one else will, independent European climate think tank E3G said last night. ""There is an immediate opportunity for the EU to leverage the political momentum from week one and the US-China statement to build the confidence that the trillions will be mobilised for developing and vulnerable countries for the net-zero and climate-resilient transformation we need."" Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Australia were reported to be resisting efforts to strengthen emission-reduction requirements, while vulnerable countries were seeking more robust commitments on adaptation, loss and damage, and climate finance and going beyond the issue of delivering on $100 billion a year to include ""mobilising the trillions through the whole global financial architecture"", it added. Bad signal European Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans said removing a text reference on phasing out coal and fossil-fuel subsidies would be an extremely bad signal - a view strongly echoed by Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan.""If you remove it from the text, what is the message you are sending there? Because the only way humanity can learn to live within planetary boundaries is if we rid ourselves of dependency on fossil fuels that are making our survival impossible,"" Mr Timmermans added.He said the rulebook for implementing the Paris climate agreement could be completed at Cop26. Agreeing the rulebook, which sets out detailed guidance for how countries must implement goals agreed in Paris in 2015, would be one of the key outcomes of the summit. ""It will allow us to start delivery of what was agreed six years ago in a way that is transparent for everyone and accountable for everyone."" Mr Ryan said the climate finance issue might be the last item to get across the line, with expectation that Cop26 will run into the weekend. He confirmed Mr Guterres attended an EU co-ordination meeting and underlined ""when you are close to the abyss, your next step is important"".",Copyright 2021 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|EUROPEAN UNIONAGREEMENTSCLIMATE CHANGEEMISSIONSNEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSNEGATIVE NEWSPROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONSEMERGING MARKETSCLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION & POLICYEUROPEAN UNION INSTITUTIONSGREEN FINANCEINTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONSINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUNDUNITED NATIONSDEVELOPING COUNTRIESTRENDS & EVENTSENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRYAIR QUALITY REGULATIONENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGYNEW MANUFACTURING FACILITIES|COAL FIRED PLANTSEMISSIONSENERGY & UTILITIESGREEN FINANCEINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUNDMETHANEENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRYNATURAL GASCOAL INDUSTRYNEW MANUFACTURING FACILITIES|ANTONIO GUTERRES|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATESCHINAEUROPESAUDI ARABIA",

Announcing the pact to a crowded press room, Danish climate minister Dan Jorgensen said: ""We hope today will mark the beginning of the end of oil and gas.""When I talk to scientists, citizens and activists, they all want one thing more than anything else: bold and tangible action. Not talk, action.

The world's largest oil producers, the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Canada and China, have not joined the alliance.Though the UK is not a signee to the pact, Wales has joined and the alliance is currently ""in talks"" with Scotland, Mr Jorgensen announced on Thursday. He refused to comment on the UK's decision to not join the alliance, but told reporters: ""How can you defend wanting to be carbon neutral in 2050, as some countries do, but still wanting to produce oil and gas and selling it others? That, in our view, does not add up.""At the sidelines of the launch of the alliance, the Welsh government's deputy minister for climate change Lee Waters told The Independent: ""It's all very well talking about what you're going to do in 2050, what matters is what you're going to do now. It's action not words that matter on climate change and we know that the sooner you make the change the greater the impact those emissions savings have.""The Independent's Stop Fuelling the Climate Crisis campaign has been shining a light on fossil fuel production in the UK in the year that the country hosts Cop26. An influential report from the world's energy watchdog released in May said there can be no further fossil fuel expansion anywhere if global climate targets are to be met. And accelerating the phase-out of fossil fuels is likely to feature in the final agreement from the Glasgow summit, which is scheduled to be finalised on Friday evening.Despite this, the UK has refused to rule out the possibility of new oil and gas licences in the North Sea, instead creating a ""climate compatibility checkpoint"" that it claims will ensure any new fossil fuel production will be in line with its efforts to reach net zero emissions by 2050.This claim has been disputed by scientists and environmentalists. ""UK prime minister Boris Johnson will lose what's left of his climate credibility if he fails to rule out new oil and gas and presses ahead with proposals for a new oil field at Cambo, after he's told other countries to 'pull out all the stops' at Cop26,"" said Rebecca Newsom, head of politics at Greenpeace UK. ""For this initiative to be effective, many more countries need to join and make firm commitments in their national policies to rule out all new fossil fuel projects and permits immediately.""""It is disappointing that the UK government has not signed up to this welcome initiative,"" said Lyndsay Walsh, Oxfam's climate policy adviser. ""The UK may have led the way on committing to net zero emissions, but it must now address the epic contradiction of continuing to grant oil and gas licences in the North Sea.""Ahead of the conference, The Independent obtained a letter to Mr Johnson from 70 climate scientists urging him to commit to ending new oil and gas investment in the UK.""Boris Johnson could lead the world toward a bright future if he would announce such a plan or firm intentions to construct such a plan,"" Dr James Hansen, a former Nasa scientist known for his role in raising the alarm on the climate crisis, told The Independent in October. ""Without such, Cop26 will be just like the prior Cops, a bullshit session where leaders promise to pursue goals for some period in the distant future.""Fred Njehu, Greenpeace Africa's senior policy advisor, said the new initiative announced on Thursday brought welcome attention to the need to move away from oil and gas production. ""For too long oil and gas has got away with being ignored as the world focuses on getting rid of coal. But the time for them hiding behind their dirty big brother is over,"" he said. ""Burning oil and gas is driving the climate crisis and it's right that these countries are finally shining the light on them.""A UK government spokesperson claimed that ""no other significant oil and gas producing nation has gone as far as the UK in supporting sector's gradual transition to a low carbon future"".""While the UK's reliance on fossil fuels continues to fall, there will continue to be ongoing but diminishing need for oil and gas over the coming years while we ramp up renewable energy capacity, as recognised by the independent Climate Change Committee,"" the spokesperson said.

120,An emblem of Scotland': how Irn-Bru stole the show at Cop26,"November 12, 2021 Friday",Non-jurisdictional,The Guardian (London),News,924,BUSINESS;Version:1,924,,Mark Sweney,,A G BARR PLC,A G BARR PLC,An emblem of Scotland': how Irn-Bru stole the show at Cop26,"As Cop26 draws to a close, the climate summit's big-name sponsors have been left scratching their heads as to how the plucky Scottish fizzy drink Irn-Bru managed to steal the limelight in the marketing ambush of the year.The status of the bright orange drink as the summit's surprise curiosity made global headlines earlier this week when the US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez posted an Instagram video  of herself praising the beverage  after having her first taste.AOC, as she is known, was urged to try the drink by the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, who handed her distinguished foreign guest a can on her arrival in Glasgow and then posted a selfie of the moment on Twitter.  ?????????????????? Amidst all the serious business at #COP26  today, I'm pleased to also report that @AOC  now has a supply of Irn Bru pic.twitter.com/3yhisZ9PiN  - Nicola Sturgeon (@NicolaSturgeon) November 10, 2021The subsequent social media explosion and acres of online and print column inches have given the brand a golden marketing moment that millions of pounds of advertising couldn't hope to emulate.""It is priceless getting this sort of media attention,"" says Colin Kennedy, the chief executive of content creation agency Redwood. ""Brands very rarely manage to create these sorts of headlines. Sturgeon and AOC have emerged as two ambassadors for Irn-Bru in what looks like a completely authentic, unstaged moment.""While official sponsors from Sky to Sainsbury's paid millions to burnish their green credentials by being featured at the event, and populated panels with executives, Irn-Bru leveraged its status as a national champion to sew up the on-site fizzy drink market.Its parent company, AG Barr, had an existing deal in place that shut out rivals such as Coke and Pepsi, to make Irn-Bru - often referred to as Scotland's other national drink (after whisky) - the only fizzy drink available at the SEC and SSE Hydro convention centres in Glasgow used during Cop26. The deal with Glasgow Life, which operates the venues, made AG Barr the exclusive soft drink and water supplier.""That was the clever bit of marketing: availability at the venue,"" says Kennedy. ""But Irn-Bru is also a kind of proxy for the national drink of Scotland, and it comes with the support of people like Sturgeon.""While almost impossible to estimate, the value of the media coverage would run into the millions for Irn-Bru. A single ad slot on the front page of a UK national newspaper can run to about £15,000, and up to £300,000 for a ""wrap"" of the Sun, according to media buyers. Buying the digital ad space to reach the millions of readers of the coverage, as well as viewers of ACO's video, would have run to hundreds of thousands of pounds media spend.However, the coverage has been through editorial content, considered to be much more engaging and therefore valuable than running ads. Experts say the free coverage is worth several million pounds at least in equivalent media value if such a publicity stunt had been achieved by a PR agency.Aside from Donald Trump, who banned it from his luxury golf resort  in Turnberry in 2018, Irn-Bru has a legion of high-profile supporters. Andy Murray eschewed other beverage options to toast his 2012 US Open victory with it, the late Sir Sean Connery reportedly chose a crate of Irn-Bru to represent Scotland at an exhibit at the Museum of Scotland, and in June the Queen and the Duke of Cambridge, Prince William, paid a visit to a new processing factory.Launched in 1901, supposedly as an alternative to beer for steelworkers building Glasgow station, it was originally called Iron Brew but changed to Irn-Bru in 1946 - a decision forced on AG Barr, because the drink isn't actually brewed.The beverage, which has its own tartan, joins the likes of Coca-Cola and KFC in having a secret recipe - in Irn-Bru's case, 32 ingredients known by as few as three people.Despite being a brand giant in Scotland, supposedly the only country in the world where Coke is available but is not the most popular fizzy drink, its carefully cultivated image as a brand challenger makes it palatable for political figures to promote.""Would they have been seen grabbing Coca-Cola or a 7UP and posting like that, no chance,"" says Mark Borkowski, a PR expert. ""They see the quirkiness of Irn-Bru as an emblem of Scotland: it's OK to like it. And like Marmite, it is an acquired taste - those sorts of products always get strong reactions."" Irn-Bru's Instagram account runs with the line ""Let's Just Agree It Tastes Like Magic"".Despite the priceless publicity, AG Barr's share price has remained fairly flat during the Glasgow gathering. The group - which owns or licenses 16 brands including Rubicon, Snapple and Bundaberg - is listed on the London Stock Exchange, but its largest shareholder is still Robin Barr, the former chairman and great-grandson of the founder. The company made £227m in revenues in the year to 24 January 2021, but is not a particularly global business, saying that it ""sells mainly to customers in the UK with some international sales"".""It's been phenomenal to give people from across the globe a unique taste of Irn-Bru during Cop26,"" a spokesperson for the company said. However, it is mindful that while the free publicity makes for a marketing dream it musn't be seen to be ""overshadowing or trivialising the importance of the conference for its own gain"". While the publicity has not moved the share price, the orange stuff seems to have won some new fans among a select group of green grandees.","Copyright 2021 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

There is still a lot more work to be done - time is running out,"" he said.""As I speak my ministerial facilitators and negotiators are rolling up their sleeves and working hard to find solutions to some of the most intractable issues.""The draft text of the Cop26 deal notes ""with serious concern"" that existing global agreements are insufficient to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees.The draft, which sets out what negotiators hope will be the outcome of Cop26, asks countries to ""revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their nationally determined contributions, as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022"".",Copyright 2021 City A.M.

She's the one holding me to account on my efforts - like many of the next generation are to their parents and grandparents - and she's absolutely right.My eight-year-old knows that Cop26 is going on - or at least she's heard that there's a big climate change conference happening.She and her friends are learning about it at school, talking about what they can do and believing that they - and all of us - can make a difference.She can't understand why all of us aren't talking about it too.After all, what's more important than saving the world from a global warming disaster that will melt ice caps, cause the sea level to rise, kill thousands of species, and displace and kill millions of people?And so, true to my word, this column is devoted to Cop26.But unlike most media commentators I've seen up to now, I'm not going to dismiss the summit as a Cop out.It's too easy to shout greenwash when all the headlines we hear are about Boris Johnson flying to Scotland in a private jet, falling asleep, maskless, next to Sir David Attenborough or Greta Thunberg dismissing the gathering of world leaders as a total failure.Even Johnson himself declared the commitments made by the delegates at COP 'a drop in the rapidly warming ocean'.But this week there have been some big developments.A joint US-China declaration pledging to keep the increase in the Earth's temperature to 'well below' two degrees Celsius and promising to work together to narrow the gap between their current emissions reduction plans and what scientists say is necessary to meet that goal was a big moment.The draft 'cover decisions' document for Cop26, released on Wednesday, also points to a strengthening of the Paris agreement from 2015, calling on countries to 'accelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels' and an emphasis on the need to pursue the lower temperature goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius.And those positives from the summit, however small, are ones we have to cling on to.Because as long as the emphasis remains on the failings and the socalled greenwash of it all, it makes it easier for each and every one of us to avoid doing our own bit.Why go plastic free when you can instead blame India or China for chucking industrial quantities of plastic waste into the ocean every day?Why bother recycling or reducing your paper use when you can point to Brazil wiping out whole rainforests overnight?Why switch to an electric car when emissions from factories and industrial plants and commercial vehicles are so polluting and apparently so little is being done to change that?But, like my daughter, we have to believe the little changes that we're trying to make in our own lives will make a difference.Speaking at the opening of the summit last week, Sir David Attenborough urged world leaders to be 'motivated by hope, not fear, to avoid the climate catastrophe.It's that hope that should be motivate us all.Well that - and the fear that my daughter will tell me off if I don't do the right thing.we have to believe the little changes that we're trying to make in our own lives will make a difference",Copyright 2021 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved,,Newspaper|WMN|ENGLISH|National Edition|CLIMATE CHANGEEMISSIONSGLOBAL WARMINGGREENWASHINGAGREEMENTSGLACIERS & ICEBERGSNEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSPOLLUTION & ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTSCONFERENCES & CONVENTIONSSCIENCE & TECHNOLOGYPLASTIC POLLUTIONPLASTIC WASTEELECTRIC VEHICLE INDUSTRYINDUSTRIAL POLLUTIONMANUFACTURING FACILITIESELECTRIC VEHICLESRAIN FORESTS|EMISSIONSGLOBAL WARMINGGREENWASHINGENERGY & UTILITIESPLASTIC POLLUTIONPLASTIC WASTEELECTRIC VEHICLE INDUSTRYMANUFACTURING FACILITIESELECTRIC VEHICLES|GRETA THUNBERG|EARTH|CHINAINDIA,
123,Negotiators urged to 'strain every sinew' as Cop26 talks enter final day,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,standard.co.uk,News,315,"NEWS,UK;Version:12",315,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Emily Beament,,,,Negotiators urged to 'strain every sinew' as Cop26 talks enter final day,"The Cop26 climate talks are entering their final scheduled day with the summit's president warning there is still ""a monumental challenge ahead"".The talks are scheduled to finish at 6pm on Friday, but could overrun as negotiators come under pressure to resolve issues around finance for poor countries, calls for accelerating the phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies and coal, and the efforts of countries to cut emissions in the 2020s.A new version of the overarching deal that could be agreed at the summit in Glasgow  is expected overnight into Friday.The first draft of the ""cover decision"" urges countries to ""revisit and strengthen"" targets for cutting emissions by 2030 in their national plans, to align them by the end of 2022 with the Paris  goal of keeping temperature rises to ""well below 2C"" or to 1.5C.The document published on Wednesday includes a call for developed countries to at least double their collective provision of finance to help developing countries adapt to climate change, as part of scaling up funding for poorer nations to tackle the crisis and address loss and damage.Some of the most vulnerable nations have raised concerns about the lack of detail.It is thought the commitment to phase out fossil fuels, the first time this has appeared in such a text, is unlikely to make it into the final document.As the talks entered the final stretch, Cop26 president Alok Sharma  warned: ""We still have a monumental challenge ahead of us, but collectively we have no choice but to rise to that challenge and strain every sinew to achieve a timely outcome that we can all be proud of.""Because ultimately, this outcome, whatever it is, will belong to all of us.""

124,The changes to the Cop26 draft text and what they mean,"November 12, 2021 Friday",Non-jurisdictional,The Guardian (London),News,4666,ENVIRONMENT;Version:1,4666,,Fiona Harvey Environment correspondent,,,,The changes to the Cop26 draft text and what they mean,"A second draft of the outcome of the Cop26 climate summit has been published. It will be subject to many further revisions before the final outcome is published, probably on Saturday or even Sunday.Key provisions are still in there, including one calling for countries to return to the negotiating table next year because current targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions are inadequate to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the tougher of two goals in the 2015 Paris climate agreement.There is also a reference to phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies, which has not been substantially weakened, though some civil society groups have complained that it should be stronger.Here are some of the key points: I. Science and urgency 1. Recognizes the importance of the best available science for effective climate action and policymaking; The first draft began with just ""science"" but the second draft has added ""and urgency"" - that's a strengthening that might easily go unnoticed. This is the very first paragraph after the preamble, and it's easy to overlook but it really is very important. The best available science is at the core of the 1992 UN framework convention on climate change and of the 2015 Paris agreement. And the best available science has changed notably since 1992, and since 2015.The Paris agreement contains two key goals: to limit global temperature rises to ""well below"" 2C above pre-industrial levels, and to ""pursue efforts"" to limit heating to 1.5C.In October 2018, at the behest of the 2015 Paris climate summit, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - the global authority on climate science - produced a special report on what 1.5C would mean. That report found serious damages from 1.5C of heating, including the inundation of some low-lying areas by sea level rises and storm surges; an increase in extreme weather such as heatwaves, droughts, floods and intensifying storms; an accelerated melting of ice that could rapidly become irreversible; and the die-off of coral reefs.The world is currently at about 1.1C of heating and the increase in extreme weather around the world is already apparent.So the reaffirmation of ""the best available science"" is one of the key ways for negotiators to focus attention on the tougher 1.5C goal, rather than the upper ""well below"" 2C limit, without being accused of trying to reopen the Paris agreement. Christiana Figueres and Laurence Tubiana, two of the three architects of the Paris agreement, told the Guardian that to be guided by the science was at the core of the Paris agreement and must be at the core of any outcome from Glasgow.3. Expresses alarm and utmost concern that human activities have caused around 1.1 °C of warming to date, that impacts are already being felt in every region, and that carbon budgets consistent with achieving the Paris Agreement temperature goal are now small and being rapidly depleted;Again, a small change but interesting: the previous draft noted ""alarm and concern"" - that was quite strong, but it has been upgraded to ""utmost concern"". And there's an additional reference to the carbon budgets being ""small""; that wasn't there before. Some of these words may not make it into the final text, but the tactic of beefing up the science and concern is consistent with the desire of many countries to focus attention on 1.5C and the sense of urgency that is needed to bolster their insistence that negotiators must come back next year with strengthened national plans on emissions (known as nationally determined contributions or NDCs).II. Adaptation 6. Notes with serious concern the findings from the contribution of Working Group I to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report, including that climate and weather extremes and the adverse impacts on people and nature will continue to increase with every additional increment of rising temperatures; 7. Emphasizes the urgency of scaling up action and support, including finance, capacitybuilding and technology transfer, to enhance adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change in line with the best available science, taking into account the priorities and needs of developing country Parties; 8. Welcomes the adaptation communications and national adaptation plans submitted to date, which enhance the understanding and implementation of adaptation actions and priorities; 9. Urges Parties to further integrate adaptation into local, national and regional planning; 10. Requests Parties that have not yet done so to submit their adaptation communications in accordance with decision 9/CMA.1 ahead of the fourth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement so as to provide timely input to the global stocktake; 11. Recognizes the importance of the global goal on adaptation for the effective implementation of the Paris Agreement, and welcomes the launch of the comprehensive two-year XX work programme on the global goal on adaptation;The section on adaptation has been much expanded from the initial text. This is good for developing countries, whose key concerns are adaptation and finance. They still regard this text as insufficient, but the crucial ""balance"" - how much weight the concerns over adaptation and finance are given, compared with obligations on reducing emissions (known as mitigation) - is improved in this draft. Setting up a work programme may seem feeble and ""can-kicking"", but in the context of the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement it means the issue becomes a focus of attention, with proper accountability for progress within the process, and an assurance that all parties will have their view heard.18. Urges developed country Parties to at least double their collective provision of climate finance for adaptation to developing country Parties from the current level by 2025 as a step towards achieving a balance between mitigation and adaptation in the provision of scaled-up financial resources, recalling Article 9, paragraph 4, of the Paris Agreement;The Guardian understands that some developed countries want to remove the reference to doubling climate finance for adaptation. But for developing countries this is a major concern. Most of the climate finance currently provided - which already falls short of the $100bn a year promised by 2020 - goes to projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as renewable energy, and goes to middle-income countries rather than the poorest. Focusing on adaptation would direct more money to the poorest, and enable them to press ahead with vital resilience projects that are essential to safeguard them against the worsening impacts of extreme weather.III. Mitigation20. Reaffirms the Paris Agreement temperature goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels; 21. Recognizes that the impacts of climate change will be much lower at the temperature increase of 1.5 °C compared with 2 °C and resolves to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C; 22. Also recognizes that limiting global warming to 1.5 °C requires rapid, deep and sustained reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions, including reducing global carbon dioxide emissions by 45 per cent by 2030 relative to the 2010 level and to net zero around mid-century, as well as deep reductions in non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases; 23. Further recognizes that this requires accelerated action in this critical decadeThe Guardian understands that some countries wanted to remove the entire section on mitigation. Reaffirming the Paris goals is essential, and these words are consistent with the countries who want to focus attention on 1.5C. This text retains key language on how far emissions need to be cut this decade and underlines once again why action this decade is crucial.This will bolster those who want to ""keep 1.5C alive"".28. Urges Parties that have not yet communicated new or updated nationally determined contributions to do so as soon as possible in advance of the fourth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement; 29. Recalls Articles 3 and 4, paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 11, of the Paris Agreement and requests Parties to revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their nationally determined contributions as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022, taking into account different national circumstances; 30. Also requests the secretariat to update the synthesis report on nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement annually, to be made available to each session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement; 31. Decides to convene an annual high-level ministerial round table on pre-2030 ambition, beginning at the fourth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement; 32. Urges Parties that have not yet done so to communicate, by the fourth session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement, long term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies referred to in Article 4, paragraph 19, of the Paris Agreement towards just transition to net zero emissions by or around midcentury, taking into account different national circumstances; 33. Invites Parties to update the strategies referred to in paragraph 32 above regularly, as appropriate, in line with the best available science;Countries are still being asked to come back next year to strengthen their NDCs. That is at the heart of this conference, and the slight change in language - from ""urge"" countries to return to ""request"" - is not a massive change in the context of the legalese used in the Paris agreement. The crucial point here is that countries will have to return next year to scrutinise NDCs again, and there's enough language around and about it to ensure that such scrutiny is in line with the 1.5C target.Revisiting countries' targets next year is absolutely essential, the three architects of the original Paris agreement have exclusively told the Guardian.  36. Calls upon Parties to accelerate the development, deployment and dissemination of technologies and the adoption of policies for the transition towards low-emission energy systems, including by rapidly scaling up clean power generation and accelerating the phaseout of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels;Some activists have been angry that the language on coal and fossil fuels has been watered down. The previous text read simply: Calls upon Parties to accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels; However, the addition of a reference to ""unabated"" coal is not surprising. That's the standard term used, in order to allow for countries to keep open the possibility of using carbon capture and storage technology to cut emissions from coal-fired power plants. It's surprising that it wasn't in the original, in fact.As for ""inefficient"" subsidies - some countries argue that they need to be allowed to continue to protect their poor and most vulnerable citizens against high fuel prices, and that being unable to do so could cause serious hardship. Some NGOs regard this as a fig leaf, but these countries do have a point.The important thing to note is that no Cop decision text has explicitly referred to a phase-out of coal or fossil fuel subsidies before, so it is surprising to many that this reference is still in. Fossil fuel producers are avid in protecting their interests, and the Cops run by consensus, so agreement has often in the past been held up by the work of fossil fuel producers behind the scenes.V Finance, technology transfer and capacity-building for mitigation and adaptation 40. Urges developed country Parties to provide enhanced support, including through financial resources, technology transfer and capacity-building, to assist developing country Parties with respect to both mitigation and adaptation, in continuation of their existing obligations under the Convention and the Paris Agreement, and encourages other Parties to provide or continue to provide such support voluntarily;Finance is the key sticking point for developing countries at these negotiations, and they are still hoping for more action on this. There's a small but significant addition to this text - the reference to developed countries needing to provide support to developing countries is standard, but ""other parties to provide or continue to provide such support voluntarily"".That means big economies that are still classed as developing, such as China, being encouraged to provide climate finance alongside the historically industrialised world.VI. Loss and damage61. Acknowledges that climate change has already caused and will increasingly cause loss and damage and that, as temperatures rise, impacts from climate and weather extremes, as well as slow onset events, will pose an ever-greater social, economic and environmental threat;Loss and damage refers to the ravages of climate breakdown that are so severe they can't be protected against or adapted to - for instance, the devastation caused by a hurricane or cyclone. For poor countries, this is separate to the need for finance for adaptation. But up to now, although loss and damage has been recognised as an issue at the talks, there has been now funding made available for loss and damage. Cop26 is still only taking baby steps on this key issue for developing countries, and poor countries will want to see much more on this before there is a text they can fully support.22172021-11-12T13:06:49Zfalsefalse2021-11-12T13:08:15ZUKtheguardian.comhttps://www.theguardian.com/p/jtxn3falsetruehttps://media.guim.co.uk/8e2320dced8dba17731b847c497430240fe6bb03/0_170_2792_1676/500.jpgfalseentrueA second draft of the outcome of the Cop26 climate summit has been published.

125,UN: 'All hands on deck' for Cop26 negotiations,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Western Mail,News,495,NEWS;Pg. 11,495,England & Wales,PRESS ASSOCIATION REPORTERS,,,,UN: 'All hands on deck' for Cop26 negotiations,"THE United Nations secretary general said the response to the climate crisis ""requires all hands on deck"".Antonio Guterres told the Cop26 conference that the world remains ""on track for a catastrophic temperature rise well above 2C"".Speaking at the climate summit in Glasgow yesterday afternoon, he said: ""Keeping the 1.5 goal within reach means reducing emissions globally by 45% by 2030. But the present set of nationally determined contributions - even if fully implemented - will still increase emissions by 2030.""According to the latest joint analysis of the nationally determined contributions by UNEP and UNFCCC, we remain on track for a catastrophic temperature rise well above 2C.""Net-zero pledges require rapid, sustained emissions cuts this decade.""Governments ""need to pick up the pace"" and show ambition on tackling climate change, Mr Guterres said. He told the Cop26 conference in Glasgow that ""we cannot settle for the lowest common denominator"".He welcomed a co-operation agreement between the United States and China announced on Wednesday, but added: ""Promises ring hollow when the fossil fuels industry still receives trillions in subsidies, as measured by the IMF.""Or when countries are still building coal plants.""Or when carbon is still without a price - distorting markets and investors decisions.""Every country, every city, every company, every financial institution, must radically, credibly and verifiably reduce their emissions and decarbonise their portfolios starting now.""Mr Guterres warned nations not to make ""hollow"" promises on tackling climate change.The United Nations secretary general told the Cop26 conference: ""The announcements here in Glasgow are encouraging - but they are far from enough.""The emissions gap remains a devastating threat, the finance and adaptation gap represent a glaring injustice for the developing world.""We need even more ambition in future revised nationally determined contributions, we need pledges to be implemented.""We need commitments to turn concrete, we need actions to be verified, we need to bridge the deep and real credibility gap.""Earlier, Cop26 climate summit president Alok Sharma reiterated to delegates there is still a lot more work to be done to secure agreement.The penultimate day of the talks ""must represent another gearshift"" in negotiations, Mr Sharma has said, as countries try to resolve political differences in a number of areas that still need to be hammered out.Overnight, new draft texts were published for negotiations that are going on in a number of areas, including on providing future finance for poorer countries to develop cleanly and cope with the impacts of climate change - where Mr Sharma said he was concerned about progress.There were also draft texts on supporting countries to adapt to climate change, and on addressing the loss and damage to vulnerable nations caused by climate-driven extreme weather.A new draft of the cover decision was expected overnight.",Copyright 2021 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|WMN|ENGLISH|National Edition|UNITED NATIONSCLIMATE CHANGEEMISSIONSINTERNATIONAL RELATIONSNEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSAGREEMENTSCLIMATOLOGYCONFERENCES & CONVENTIONSGOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERSUNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONSWEATHERCARBON NEUTRAL INITIATIVESCLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION & POLICYINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUNDSEVERE WEATHEREMERGING MARKETS|EMISSIONSCARBON NEUTRAL INITIATIVESENERGY & UTILITIESINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUNDFOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTSCOAL FIRED PLANTSBANKING & FINANCECOAL INDUSTRY|ANTONIO GUTERRES|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|CHINAUNITED STATES",

127,Cop26 reveals limits of Biden's promise to 'lead by example' on climate crisis,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Guardian (London),News,959,ENVIRONMENT;Version:1,959,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Oliver Milman,,,,Cop26 reveals limits of Biden's promise to 'lead by example' on climate crisis,"The crucial UN climate talks in Scotland have produced landmark commitments to phase out coalmining, to call time on the internal combustion engines and to compensate poorer countries for damage caused by the climate crisis.The United States, which has trumpeted its regained climate leadership at the summit, has not joined any these pledges as the talks draw to a close.This disconnect has provided the world with a muddled sense of America's willingness to confront the unfolding climate catastrophe, with the fate of historic legislation to lower planet-heating emissions still uncertain ahead of an expected vote in Congress next week.Joe Biden arrived in Glasgow vowing  the US will ""lead by example"" on climate change and avoid disastrous global heating beyond 1.5C, dispatching his entire cabinet to the Cop26 talks and making widely praised new promises to cut methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and to end deforestation.Two dozen Democratic lawmakers wearing congressional lapel pins have swept the conference venue this week, all expressing confidence that the vast $1.75tn spending bill will pass back home.""This is the most ambitious climate legislation of all time,"" Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, told the summit. ""America is back and is ready to lead,"" added Kathy Castor, chair of the House select committee on the climate crisis. ""Once we pass this historic package, finally, it will help keep 1.5C alive.""We have to actually deliver the action in order to get the respect intentionally. It's that simple  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez    But the US is bedeviled by its recent past and - many delegates of other countries fear - its potential future, following Donald Trump's embrace of climate science denialism and American isolationism. ""We have not recovered our moral authority,"" admitted Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive New York representative, when asked about the specter of the former president. ""I believe we are making steps, but we have to actually deliver the action in order to get the respect internationally. It's that simple.""There is also mounting criticism that Biden's actions have not matched his words and that the US president's negotiators haven't pushed hard enough for an ambitious deal in Glasgow to secure the deep emissions cuts needed to avoid disastrous warming that will spur ever-worsening floods, heatwaves and wildfires. More than 40 countries announced at Cop26 a promise to end the mining of coal, the dirtiest of fossil fuels, although the US was conspicuously absent from the list. ""It's very disappointing because the science is quite clear that we have to turn sharply away from coal this decade if we are going to meet our climate goals,"" said Rachel Cleetus, policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists.""We need very clear signals that orientate the US towards clean energy,"" she added. ""The climate crisis is too dire to just wait for coal to fall out. It's just another signal of the sway the fossil fuel industry still has over US politics.""Despite its attempts to expand the rollout of electric vehicles, the Biden administration has also declined to set an end date for the sale of new gasoline and diesel cars, unlike the UK, European Union, Canada, India and a slew of other countries at Cop26. Its delegation in Glasgow is similarly wary of a push to provide ""loss and damage"" payments to countries vulnerable to climate impacts and has sought to shift criticism towards the inaction of China and Russia , although the US and China did unveil an unexpected plan to work together on cutting emissions, despite the enmity between the two countries.This reticence, critics claim, undermines Biden's credibility on climate. Others say the dysfunctional nature of Congress, where sweeping climate legislation to expand renewable energy and wind down fossil fuels is effectively in the hands of a senator who derives most of his income from investments in coal , is to blame.""There is a handful of members of Congress who represent coal-intensive parts of the country who see [climate action] as a threat to their region,"" Sean Casten, a Democratic representative, told the Guardian. ""It's kept the president from doing all that he'd like to do.""Pete Buttigieg, the US transport secretary, told the Guardian that the Biden administration aims to give Americans better public transit options, as well as electric vehicle rebates and infrastructure, but that ""each country is on its own path"" to ending the age of fossil fuel-powered cars.""What we are talking about is a race to the ambitious targets the president has set,"" Buttigieg said, adding that the goal of half of all car sales being electric by 2030 will be in itself a ""massive lift"".Biden will face further scrutiny almost immediately after some sort of deal is struck in Glasgow, not only over the fate of the Build Back Better bill but also his issuance of permits for oil and gas drilling.An auction of 80m acres of the Gulf of Mexico seabed, an area larger than the UK, will be offered  to fossil fuel companies next week, while a new report  has warned that the oil and gas that will be burned in the Permian Basin, a geological formation in the south-west US, by 2050 will release nearly 40bn tons of carbon dioxide, nearly a tenth of the remaining global ""carbon budget"" to stay under 1.5C.""If the Biden administration wants to be serious about its promise to demonstrate US climate leadership, it must first clean up its own back yard,"" said Steven Feit, senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law.""The Permian Basin is the single largest fracking basin globally, and the continued reckless pursuit of oil extraction from New Mexico to the Gulf coast is the ultimate display of hypocrisy.

128,Khan urges world leaders at Cop26 to 'redouble efforts',"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),News,493,NEWS;Pg. 9,493,England & Wales,DAISY DUNNE CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT,,,,Khan urges world leaders at Cop26 to 'redouble efforts',"Countries must ""redouble their efforts"" in the final hours of the Cop26 climate summit to attempt to keep hopes alive of limiting global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, Sadiq Khan has said.Speaking to The Independent in Glasgow, the mayor of London said countries must commit to renewing their climate promises more often to get the momentum needed to meet the 1.5C aspiration of the Paris Agreement.He added that he had been frustrated to see nations prioritising ""targets over action"" and said that the era of climate deniers had been replaced by one of ""climate delayers"".""Cop has to be a success because the alternative isn't worth thinking about,"" he told The Independent.""Humanity is at a crisis point. We saw in London the consequences of flash flooding in summer, the Tube being closed down and homes being flooded. We saw the floods in New York, Germany and wildfires in Greece.""I'm hoping in the last few hours everyone redoubles their efforts.""His comments come as UK minister and Cop president Alok Sharma warned that negotiators still face a ""monumental challenge"" in reaching consensus on key issues before the summit's scheduled finish time on Friday.""Whilst we have made progress, we are not there yet on the most crucial issues,"" he said. ""Time is running out.""How to include the need to drastically move away from fossil fuels in the final Glasgow text is reported to be a key sticking point for countries hammering out a deal.On Thursday, a small group of countries led by Denmark and Costa Rica announced that they would forge a path to ending new oil and gas production, a step scientists say will be crucial to meeting global climate goals.However, the UK government, which is hosting the Glasgow summit, said it would not join the international alliance aimed at moving away from fossil fuels.Mr Khan said that the UK's decision to snub the agreement showed a lack of leadership. ""We should be leading by example,"" he said.The mayor today attended a meeting with UN chief Antonio Guterres and other city leaders to mark ""cities day"" at Cop26.Last week, he was elected the new chair of C40 cities, a group of 97 city mayors from across the world aiming to take action on the climate crisis.He said that he believed cities could take the lead on tackling the climate crisis where national governments had fallen behind.""More than two-thirds of the C40 cities are either on course to meet the promises made at Paris or have exceeded that,"" he said.""That's versus the only country I could find that's meeting the Paris Agreement and that's the Gambia.""He added that he was still hopeful that nations could make positive progress to address the climate crisis at Cop26.""The key thing that needs to come out of this Cop is optimism,"" he said.""If pessimism or defeat comes out of this, that doesn't bode well for national governments or for the sectors, businesses or mayors.

129,Second Cop26 draft text: Coal phaseout remains in but some language softened,"November 12, 2021 Friday",Non-jurisdictional,The Guardian (London),News,1082,ENVIRONMENT;Version:1,1082,,"Fiona Harvey, Damian Carrington, Adam Morton and agencies",,,,Second Cop26 draft text: Coal phaseout remains in but some language softened,"Countries are being called on to accelerate the phaseout of coal power at the Cop26 summit, and to return to the negotiating table next year with improvements to their national plans on cutting greenhouse gases.The second draft of the key outcome from the Cop26 summit, now nearing its final hours in Glasgow after a fortnight of intense talks, showed a slight softening of language in some instances but retained the core demands for a return.The three architects of the landmark 2015 Paris climate agreement have told the Guardian  that a return to the negotiating table next year to revise countries' national emissions-cutting targets - known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) - must be the key outcome of the talks if the world is to limit global heating to 1.5C.There was a slight change in the language in the text with regards to NDC revisions - the previous text, published on Thursday morning, ""urged"" parties to make revisions, while the current draft ""requests"" them to do so. However, the latter mirrors the language used in the Paris agreement, so the change was not regarded as a significant weakening.The latest draft proposal from the Cop26 chair, released soon after 7am on Friday in Glasgow, calls on countries to accelerate ""the phaseout of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels.""A previous version on Wednesday had called on countries to ""accelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuel."" The addition of ""inefficient"" could help countries that want to retain some fuel subsidies for the poor, while removing subsidies for major fossil fuel interests. This change to the language could also provide cover for countries that want to retain subsidies, however.The issue of fossil fuel subsidies has long vexed climate experts, with calls to reduce the subsidies over two decades going largely unheeded. However, to have any language on phasing out fossil fuels and subsidies to them in the cover decision of a Cop is new and if the provision is retained in the final outcome it will mark an increased determination by many countries to face down fossil fuel producers at the talks.A requirement for countries to revise NDCs reflects the expression of alarm by many parties, including the most vulnerable developing countries, over the chasm between carbon targets and the deep cuts necessary to limit temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.Current national plans - known as nationally determined contributions  (NDCs) - would lead to 2.4C of heating , according to an influential analysis this week by Climate Action Tracker.Countries are currently expected to return with better pledges in 2025, under the Paris agreement, but many are now demanding the deadline should be brought forward. This is seen as the most closely fought area of disagreement as the UK hosts struggle to broker a deal.The question of when and how to revise NDCs is crucial because although the Glasgow talks will continue at least to the end of Friday, and probably well into this weekend, there is now no possibility that governments will toughen their NDCs at this summit. But a clause in the draft text  that will form the main outcome of the talks would allow for a return next year to update and strengthen the targets.Developing countries are concerned that there is not enough reassurance for them for them on climate finance, a core issue for countries struggling to cope with the impacts of extreme weather.Helen Mountford of the World Resources Institute said that the draft showed some progress in this area. ""Some elements look like they could be stronger, particularly adaptation, finance and loss and damage, that was really very much needed,"" she said. These issues are the funding for clean development, adapting to climate impacts and paying for unavoidable damage. ""It is now giving specific dates, requesting countries to double adaptation finance by the end of 2025.""But she added: ""On the $100 billion [promised] from 2020 annually, there's still no reference to making up the shortfall since we know countries failed to meet that goal in 2020 and 2021. So that's definitely a gap."" The $100bn was promised back in 2009, to be delivered in 2020 and the failure has damaged trust between rich donor nations and poorer recipient nations.Experts said on Friday morning that negotiators would now be in close consultation with senior officials in their country capitals, as aspects of the text would need to be decided at the highest levels of government for many countries. The text is regarded as strong by many developing countries, but they expect it to come under fierce attack today from fossil fuel producing countries in particular.Finance ministers are expected to meet at 11am, with a stock take by all parties expected at midday. The UK's Cop president Alok Sharma is engaged in last-minute shuttle diplomacy among parties.Bob Ward, of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change said: ""This text appears to deal with many of the major issues that need to be resolved, but some important aspects still need to be finalised and may take some time to conclude. The text ""requests"", rather than commits, countries to deliver updated and more ambitious pledges by the end of next year, recognising that the planned emissions cuts collectively are still not consistent with holding warming to no more than 1.5 Celsius degrees.""But he added: ""The call for countries to phase-out unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies is very important and historic. Unabated coal power releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and all subsidies for fossil fuels are inefficient.""Since the Paris agreement was signed, binding countries to limit temperature rises ""well below"" 2C above pre-industrial levels while ""pursuing efforts"" to a 1.5C limit, new science has shown that breaching the 1.5C threshold would lead to disastrous impacts, some irreversible, including the inundation of many low-lying areas. Heating has now reached 1.1C, and extreme weather is already taking hold around the world.The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said emissions must be cut by 45% by 2030 compared with 2030 levels to stay within 1.5C.The new draft outcome text will be discussed ahead of the 6pm UK time deadline for the talks to finish. However, previous Cop summits have a history of going well into Saturday and sometimes Sunday.                     More updates soon ...

Use your position as president of this Cop to really drive progress and push people as far as we can get them.""Because every inch forward that this text takes is of course another inch towards getting the world on to a path where we avoid climate catastrophe, and nothing, literally nothing, is more important than that.""The reason I'm singling out Boris Johnson is not just because we're in the UK - well, it is actually because we're in the UK, because the UK is the Cop presidency, and that puts a particular onus on the shoulders of the UK Government.""Ms Sturgeon said the new draft deal is ""slightly better"" but it ""still has way to go"".She added: ""On the upside, there's a clear recognition that 1.5C is the goal in terms of limiting global warming. There seems to be movement on adaptation finance, there is wording on loss and damage.""On the downside, still not a delivery of the 100 billion dollars financial commitment (from developed nations to vulnerable countries), the expression of regret and disappointment - but the people who are expressing regret are the people who can deliver it. So hopefully we'll see that change.""And still the fact that, although there is a recognition that 1.5C is the goal, we are way off track to actually meet that, we're still on a track for a world of 2.4C global warming. For many parts of the world that is a death sentence.""She later tweeted: ""There's still time in the final hours of #COP26  to make the outcome better and give us a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees - which for many across the world is the difference between survival and extinction. Let's see the political will and determination to deliver.""Meanwhile she told Sky News she would not bet on Friday being the last day of the summit.She said: ""I certainly hope that finishing at 6pm tonight, which is the plan, would be possible.""Equally, I would not be surprised to know that it was going into tomorrow. That's not unusual at Cop, so nobody should read anything particular into that if it does happen.""

131,The final giant piece of a surprisingly successful Cop26;Beijing's deal with the US cements its position on the global stage and brings a 1.7 degree world into range,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Daily Telegraph (London),News,1081,BUSINESS;Pg. 4,1081,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,AMBROSE EVANS-PRITCHARD,,,,The final giant piece of a surprisingly successful Cop26Beijing's deal with the US cements its position on the global stage and brings a 1.7 degree world into range,"China got what it wanted at Cop26.The bilateral deal extracted from the US in the final innings of the climate summit is a form of diplomatic homage to Xi Jinping.It underscores that there are only two countries shaping events in the G2 world of the 21st century. The regal recognition of Sino-US parity is what matters most to Xi.What also matters is that nobody should succeed in telling China how to manage its internal affairs, or mark its homework, or dictate the pace of decommissioning coal plants. With that point established, CO2 cuts are no longer such a problem.The choreography of the US-China declaration relegates the EU to lesser status, bordering on irrelevance in great power geopolitics. The near total absence of German, French or Italian influence at this meeting has been extraordinary, as if these states had fallen off the edge of the earth.""It has really been a missed opportunity given the green deal, and it's been a surprise,"" said Laurence Tubiana, the top French negotiator during the Paris Agreement. The EU has been defensive on financing. I don't get it, and I am not happy,"" she said.Unlike the EU's green deal, China is likely to deliver on what it pledges, and the text of its commitment moves the needle further on greenhouse emissions than the pessimists care to acknowledge.It locks in the 1.5 degree aspiration, to the dismay of Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the fossil bloc, which no longer has the clout to block it. China joins the war on methane.The text is not an Augustian promise of virtue deferred. Almost all the language refers to this decade. It pledges ""enhanced climate actions"" before 2030, the date that now matters. It vows to ""phase down coal consumption during the 15th Five Year Plan"" starting in 2025.In reality, China's coal use will decline sooner. The US climate chief John Kerry said China may already have passed peak CO2 emissions, 10 years before its target date in 2030. This astonishing conclusion must reflect the thinking of US energy and intelligence officials.It is plausible once you recognise that Chinese economic exceptionalism is over. The old model of breakneck industrialisation has broken down. The workforce is contracting by 3m a year, rural migration to the cities has dried up and new household formation is collapsing. China's economic growth rate is slowing to 2pc or 3pc.Japanisation beckons.China's headlong rush into wind, solar and nuclear must therefore lead to surplus power. If Xi does not succeed in reining in coal-addicted regional bosses, economic forces will break the back of China's coal lobby by other means.The Chinese delegation had to come up with something to avoid being the villain, a role it played in Copenhagen in 2009 and now deems a mistake, but it is too simple to reduce this to political greenwashing.China's climate envoy Xie Zhenhua was a leader of the country's ""green GDP"" movement 20 years ago, with the backing of an up-and-coming regional leader in Zhejiang called Xi Jinping.China was the giant missing piece in Alok Sharma's plan for Glasgow. India had already pledged to reach 50pc clean power by 2030, bringing peak emissions into sight this decade. Carbon Brief says Narendra Modi's speech in Glasgow is worth 0.2 degrees lopped off global warming, if delivered. A good day's work.Climate Action Tracker poured a bucket of ice cold water over Cop26 earlier this week, concluding that the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) submitted so far put the world on a 2.4 degree trajectory. This hit global headlines and has fed the false story of an empty summit.The International Energy Agency said the figure falls to 1.8 degrees if you take into account all the 2030 and net-zero pledges that have been pouring in each day. China pulls down the trajectory yet further.Climate number crunching should be taken with a pinch of salt. Scientists do not agree on carbon cycle feedbacks or the tipping points. Nobody agrees - or can know - what new technology is coming and how far the costs will fall. What we do know is that almost every forecast by official agencies and governments on renewable costs have been wildly wrong for the last 15 years. The technology has blindsided them.My presumption is that markets armed with Mark Carney's $130trillion (£97trillion) credit card will now blindside them again, pulling forward the Great Disruption with brutal dispatch. Morten Bo Christiansen from the global shipping giant Maersk said his company had until very recently thought it impossible to build its first vessel powered by zero-carbon methanol before 2030. ""We've since learned a lot,"" he said.He explained to a stunned audience in Glasgow that Maersk now plans to build the first one in 2023, with more to follow rapidly in 2024 and 2025, and will never again order a ship that burns dirty bunker fuel. Its entire 740 ship fleet will progressively go net zero. Another 3pc of global emissions once thought unreachable before 2040 are moving into the ""doable"" category The last 24 hours of Cop26 will see bare-knuckled brinkmanship. There is simmering anger that the $100bn financing pledge for poor countries has not yet been nailed down. The Saudis will battle to expunge words in Sharma's draft text that ""call upon parties to accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels"".There has never been anything like this language in a Cop conclusion. ""The UK presidency has a chance to make history here. These words must stay in the text,"" said Fernanda Carvalho from the World Wildlife Fund.What is likely by Friday night or in the early hours of Saturday is a deal that brings a 1.6 or 1.7 degree world within plausible range, stunning progress given widespread fears just seven years ago that the world was on a catastrophic 4 degree path.Yet it will be decried as a failure. Hardline activists outside the official summit in the rebel Green Zone refuse to recognise that anything has been achieved. All talk is of betrayal.Michael Liebreich, founder of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, said Greta Thunberg and her youth movement are missing a trick.""Instead of saying it's all 'blah, blah, blah,' what Greta should be saying to governments and business is 'I love your pledges, they're great, now we're going to hold you to it,"" he said.Economic Intelligence For unique insight into the world's economic issues, sign up to our Economic Intelligence newsletter, by Ambrose Evans-Pritchard and Jeremy Warner www.telegraph.co.uk/ ei-newsletter",Copyright 2021 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|DTL|ENGLISH|National Edition|EUROPEAN UNIONEMISSIONSBUSINESS NEWSEMERGING MARKETSAGREEMENTSCLIMATE CHANGEECONOMIC CONDITIONSGREEN DEALSGREENHOUSE GASESECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORSECONOMIC GROWTHINTELLIGENCE SERVICES|EMISSIONSGREEN DEALSCOAL FIRED PLANTSMETHANEMEDIA & TELECOMMUNICATIONSWIND ENERGYCOAL INDUSTRYENERGY CONSUMPTION|XI JINPING|PARIS, FRANCEBEIJING, CHINA|NORTH CENTRAL CHINA|CHINAUNITED STATESSAUDI ARABIAGERMANY",
132,Andy Briggs: Phoenix insurance boss with a seat at the Cop26 table of power,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,thetimes.co.uk,News,1451,BUSINESS;Version:1,1451,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"Katherine Griffiths, Banking Editor",,,,Andy Briggs: Phoenix insurance boss with a seat at the Cop26 table of power,"For a working-class kid Andy Briggs has done well for himself. The boss of Phoenix, one of Britain's biggest insurance businesses, was in Glasgow last week hobnobbing with global figures at the Cop26 conference and is on familiar terms with the politicians and officials who run Britain.Speaking with an estuarine twang, a legacy of growing up in Essex, he is quietly assertive about the influence he can bring to bear on the government as it tries to use the huge sums in the UK's pensions and savings industry to fund green projects and regional investment. ""We want to be inside the tent but we will be quite demanding on what we need and what's important to make it happen,"" Briggs says of the negotiations over regulatory reforms needed to enable Britain's near-£2 trillion insurance industry to fund transition to net-zero carbon emissions and levelling-up investments.It is hardly surprising that the slightly geeky actuary has a seat at the table of power. Few outside the City might have heard of Phoenix but the FTSE 100-listed business has 13 million customers and manages £300 billion of assets.The group describes itself as the UK's largest long-term savings and retirement business, helping people to put away enough for their old age and then paying out when they stop working in the form of annuities. Briggs, 55, became chief executive in March last year when his predecessor Clive Bannister retired. His move followed four years at Aviva, where he ran the UK business, its largest division, but in a surprise development lost out on the top job to an internal rival.""I was quite relaxed. I had a clear view of what I wanted to do with the business."" The board disagreed and Briggs chose to leave. If his zen-like position on the wranglings at Aviva do not seem quite credible, his enthusiasm for Phoenix does: ""I couldn't be happier.""His overriding wish is to ""try to help middle Britain get a decent retirement"", and at Phoenix he can get on with it, free of the office politics he has encountered in the past.His job involves buying books of pensions that are no longer open to new business and crunching them together, improving their systems and passing on some of the benefits to customers in the form of lower charges. Phoenix is developing new savings and investments, using the Standard Life brand it bought from Standard Life Aberdeen in May and following the acquisition of the underlying insurance business for £3.3 billion in 2018. The name resonates with customers much more than Phoenix and has ""very high levels of awareness and trust"", according to Briggs.The reason for his trip to Glasgow, where he met Larry Fink, the boss of BlackRock, the world'a largest asset manager, and Michael Bloomberg, was his focus on how to direct £900 billion of people's savings - the sum the Association of British Insurers believes is possible - over 15 years to climate-friendly projects. In Phoenix's case, ""We're investing £300 billion on behalf of customers: we can make a massive difference in the goal of achieving net zero.""Briggs says that the Cop26 conference was ""great for getting lots of commitments"", but that now that needed to convert into action. He believes that that requires a more co-ordinated effort led by the government in areas such as electric cars and housing to bring supply and manufacturing, investment and customers' behaviour together.In his world of insurance, Briggs and others argue that there need to be changes to capital rules imposed by the European Union. At present it is much easier for him to invest in a coal mine than a wind farm because of reliance on historical data in setting capital levels for investments. ""We need more real- time approval.""Changes to the rules on how much pension fund money can be put into illiquid infrastructure projects are also needed, Briggs says. ""It is generally easier for other countries to invest. It is why we see a lot of Canadian and US investment into these projects. I am not saying that is a bad thing but it would be good if we could do it too.""Another big issue is how to address people's need to save more as state support recedes. The introduction in 2012 of auto-enrolment, requiring all employers to put staff into pension schemes unless they opt out, has been a big success, he says. ""Ten million people were saving for retirement. Now it is twenty million. That is a significant majority of the working population."" The government will need to consider, though, whether the present level of 8 per cent contributions split between employers and employees is enough. Briggs clearly believes it is not.There is also not enough affordable pensions advice. Only 8 per cent of people pay independent advisers for guidance on how to fund their retirement, meaning that ""92 per cent are making some of the most important decisions about retirement income without guidance and support"".The problem has arisen because UK reforms, coupled with European Union rules, have meant that people either have to pay fees for advice, which puts many off, or have access to only limited information from product providers. In contrast people on the Continent receive guidance from advisers who are paid through commissions. A change to help the vast majority of Britons to make better decisions is needed, which will require alterations to EU-inherited rules, Briggs says.He has taken a string of leadership roles in his 30 years in the industry but he says it is all about staying close to customers and staff. ""It is quite easy to end up a bit detached. Work can look nice and rosy through my glasses.""Not the most flamboyant executive, Briggs impresses colleagues with his hard work and grasp of the underpinnings of what is a highly technical industry. He says his values are from his family. ""My parents were very much working class. My dad was a painter and decorator and my mum was bringing up four kids . . . What they did impress on me was a very strong value set, the importance of right and wrong and education.""Briggs excelled at maths, setting him on course for a career he says has been a vocation, in pensions and insurance. He has four children from two marriages, including two grown-up daughters and two younger sons. ""The four of them are thick as thieves and they gang up on me.""Briggs has been able to bring his children up in comfort but he believes in opportunities for all young people and has been involved with the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children for 15 years. ""If you give little people a decent chance in life they can make a massive contribution. It is something I am very passionate about.""Most people would agree, although few have devoted the time that Briggs has to raise money for this cause. At the other end of the spectrum, helping ""ordinary folk"" to have a better old age is admirable too.                   Q&A                   What does leadership mean to you?

Does money motivate you?                    Money comes into it but what motivates me is helping ordinary people to build up their savings so they can enjoy their later life.

When I moved into sales at Prudential I had a couple of main board directors asking if I was mad as I had a good head office job. But it was the best thing I ever did: getting a chunk of time right up close and personal with customers.                   What's your favourite TV programme?

135,Cop26: Ireland refuses to back fund for poorer countries hit by climate change,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,thetimes.co.uk,News,663,NEWS;Version:1,663,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"Valerie Flynn, Glasgow",,,,Cop26: Ireland refuses to back fund for poorer countries hit by climate change,"Ireland does not support poorer countries' call for a new loss and damage fund to help them cope with the worst effects of climate change, the climate minister has said.As the Cop26 negotiations on a new global deal aimed at keeping temperature rise below 1.5 degrees enter their final 24 hours, the issue of climate finance for poor countries remains one of the most intractable strands of the talks.Countries vulnerable to sea-level rise and extreme weather such as Barbados want a new fund into which rich countries, which have done the most to cause climate change, could pay to help cover the costs of climate-related damage in the developing world.As extreme weather events become more frequent and the science linking them with climate change has advanced, longstanding calls for a loss and damage fund are centre-stage in Glasgow, with Cop26 president Alok Sharma acknowledging that ""action is needed"" on the issue.Conor O'Neill of Christian Aid, who is following the finance negotiations, said Ireland's position was ""disappointing"", given the country's strong reputation in relation to overseas development aid.He added that concessions by rich countries on loss and damage would help to unlock other sticking points within the talks, and he hoped that some EU countries - which negotiate as a bloc - would speak out in favour of the idea of separate, ring-fenced loss and damage funding.However, Eamon Ryan, the climate minister, said it would not be a good idea to set up ""a whole new bureaucracy"" to administer loss and damage funding. He argued that ""there is a connection between loss and damage and adaptation"".Ireland's climate finance aid to developing countries is focused on adaptation to climate change, such as strengthening flood barriers. Poor and climate-vulnerable countries argue that loss and damage provisions are needed because there are some climate impacts, such as more frequent hurricanes, to which they cannot adapt.Ryan said Ireland's main hopes for the outcome of the negotiations included that a ""vital"" call to phase out fossil fuel subsidies would remain in the final deal. Other UN climate deals, such as the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement, do not mention fossil fuels, and Australia and Saudi Arabia have been reported to oppose the clause.""How can we be subsidising something that is edging us closer to the abyss? That line has to remain strong,"" Ryan said.Ireland joined 11 other countries and regions in Glasgow on Thursday in establishing a new coalition that aims to set an end date for oil and gas exploration and extraction. The Beyond Oil and Gas Coalition also includes Denmark and Sweden and has been billed by the Irish delegation in Glasgow as a very significant development.However, ministers faced some tough questions when they took to the stage to launch their alliance yesterday, including how 11 mostly small countries and regions, some with little or no fossil fuel resources or production or without the power to halt extraction in their territory, could make a difference when no significant oil and gas producers had signed up. Questions were also raised about whether the initiative would simply make the member countries more dependent on fossil fuel imports.Ryan told the packed event, which drew significant international media attention as one of the first multilateral attempts to leave fossil fuels behind, that it was time to turn to clean energy sources. ""For too long we put too much pressure on the consumer, is that the right lightbulb or whatever, but instead we need to tackle the problem at the source, the wellhead,"" he said.Ireland has already stopped granting new fossil fuel exploration licences. Friends of the Earth said Ireland should now build on its existing policies by making permanent a moratorium on the development of infrastructure for importing liquefied natural gas.Ryan said Ireland would not buy out existing licences, given the expense involved and the unlikelihood of new finds.",Copyright 2021 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper; Web Publication|WEBTTO|ENGLISH|CLIMATE CHANGECLIMATOLOGYWEATHERDEVELOPING COUNTRIESFLOODS & FLOODINGGREEN FINANCEINTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCEEUROPEAN UNIONAGREEMENTSSEVERE WEATHERINTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTOFFSHORE OIL & GAS EXPLORATION & EXTRACTIONCHRISTIANS & CHRISTIANITYFOREIGN AIDOIL & GAS INCENTIVES|ENERGY & UTILITIESGREEN FINANCEOFFSHORE OIL & GAS EXPLORATION & EXTRACTIONOIL & GAS INCENTIVESOIL & GAS EXPLORATIONOIL & GAS EXPLORATION & EXTRACTIONOIL EXPLORATION|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|IRELANDBARBADOSDENMARKSAUDI ARABIAEUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES",

140,Leaders water down Cop26 climate deal: Draft weakens fossil fuel curb amid warnings that agreement is on 'life support' due to opposition from major polluters - as Nicola Sturgeon tells Boris Johnson to 'get on a train' to rescue Glasgow summit,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,MailOnline,News,958,NEWS;Version:1,958,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"David Wilcock, Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline",,,,Leaders water down Cop26 climate deal: Draft weakens fossil fuel curb amid warnings that agreement is on 'life support' due to opposition from major polluters - as Nicola Sturgeon tells Boris Johnson to 'get on a train' to rescue Glasgow summit,"•Scotland's First Minister said a deal needed 'every shoulder to the wheel'•Questioned why PM returned to London after Wednesday day trip to summit•A new version of the deal that could be agreed appeared this morning•But it seems to have watered down its push to curb fossil fuelsPlans for a deal to limit global temperature increases appear to have watered down plans for a curb on fossil fuels in the face of opposition from the world's worst polluters.Leaders at Cop26 in Glasgow today published a new draft of a potential agreement from the Glasgow summit amid warnings that hopes of a new consensus were on 'life support'.The first draft of the 'cover decision' for the overarching agreement at the summit , published earlier this week, called for countries 'to accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels'.But a new draft produced today has changed to calling on countries to accelerate the shift to clean energy systems, 'including by rapidly scaling up clean power generation and accelerating the phaseout of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels'.The inclusion of a reference to fossil fuels was a first for a UN decision document of this type but was expected to get fierce pushback from some countries - and still may not survive to the final text.Talks went on through the night and look set to overrun from their finish time of Friday evening as negotiators come under pressure to resolve issues around finance for poor countries, fossil fuels, the efforts of countries to cut emissions in the 2020s and rules on carbon markets and transparency.Greenpeace International executive director Jennifer Morgan said: 'It could be better, it should be better, and we have one day left to make it a lot, lot better. Right now the fingerprints of fossil fuel interests are still on the text and this is not the breakthrough deal that people hoped for in Glasgow.'It came as Nicola Sturgeon demanded Boris Johnson return to Scotland to help a climate deal over the line. The First Minister said a deal needed 'every shoulder to the wheel' and questioned why the PM returned to London having made a day trip to the Glasgow UN summit on Wednesday.It came after United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres last night warned that the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is 'on life support'.The summit in Scotland officially ends at 6pm today but there are suggestions that it may not go on into the weekend in search of a viable end product. No Cop in the past decade has finished on time. Ms Sturgeon told Sky News: 'In these final hours, the Prime Minister if necessary should come back here and drive this deal over the line.'Asked if she was calling for Boris Johnson to come to Glasgow, Ms Sturgeon said: 'If that is what it is going to take, then yes. He was here on Wednesday, I welcomed that. In his shoes, I may have stayed here for the remainder of the summit, but come back... every shoulder to the wheel.'I'm not in the negotiating room. That can feel frustrating sometimes. But get there, and make sure that no stone is left unturned in getting this agreement to where it needs to be.' And she warned that failure would be down to 'a lack of political will, political determination and political leadership'. The inclusion of a reference to fossil fuels was a first for a UN decision document of this type but was expected to get fierce pushback from some countries - and still may not survive to the final text.Talks went on through the night and look set to overrun from their finish time of Friday evening as negotiators come under pressure to resolve issues around finance for poor countries, fossil fuels, the efforts of countries to cut emissions in the 2020s and rules on carbon markets and transparency.The latest draft appears to have strengthened language on getting countries to 'revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets' in their national action plans by the end of 2022 to align with global goals to limit temperature rises to 'well below' 2C and try to limit them to 1.5C.The new version 'requests' countries do so, thought to be stronger language within the UN system than the previous version, which only urged them to do so.There is now a date - missing from the first draft - for when developed countries should double the provision of finance to help developing countries adapt to climate change - by 2025.The summit began with a bang as world leaders descended on Glasgow armed with a string of headline announcements, from a commitment to slash methane emissions to a plan to save the rainforests.But progress has stalled in the underlying technical and now minister-level negotiations.With one day left of scheduled talks, countries are hardly any closer to agreement over whether national emissions cutting plans must be ramped up in the short term, how climate action is reported, and how vulnerable nations are supported.Negotiations received a shot in the arm Wednesday when the United States and China - the two largest emitters - unveiled a joint climate action plan.Although it was light on detail, observers said the pact allayed concerns that frosty US-China relations entering into COP26 would derail the talks.But trust levels between rich polluters and developing nations are low after developed countries failed to stump up the $100 billion a year they promised by 2020.Finance more generally is holding up progress in Glasgow, with developing nations insisting on more money for adaptation that can help them brace for future climate shocks.Developed nations meanwhile favour a greater push on emissions reductions, something countries yet to fully electrify their grids - and largely blameless for emissions - feel is unfair.",Copyright 2021 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

142,What has been agreed at Cop26 so far? A summary of the pledges,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,thetimes.co.uk,News,969,NEWS;Version:1,969,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"Ben Webster, Tom Whipple",,,,What has been agreed at Cop26 so far? A summary of the pledges,"What does success at Cop26 look like?The goal of this conference is to ""keep 1.5 alive"". At the Paris conference in 2015, world leaders pledged to keep the average global temperature rise from pre-industrial times to ""well below"" 2C and to ""pursue efforts"" to limit it to 1.5C. We are currently at 1.1C of global warming, and the best assessment of pledges currently on the table is that they will limit the rise to 2.4C. That would expose billions more people to increased flooding, droughts, heat waves and more intense storms and could result in sea levels rising by more than a metre by 2100.The best outcome that can now be hoped for from this conference is not that we will get new pledges in Glasgow consistent with 1.5C, but rather that big emitters with weak targets for 2030, such as China, Russia, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Australia, will feel obliged by the language in the final text to submit much stronger targets next year.Will the Glasgow deal mean countries actually take greater action on climate change?Temperature reductions are achieved not through an overarching global deal which mandates them, but through ""nationally defined contributions"" (NDCs), in which each nation individually says what it will do to support the planet's climate goals. One of the key passages in the draft text of the Glasgow deal concerns how these NDCs will be ""ratcheted"" up. The latest draft ""requests"" that countries ""revisit and strengthen"" their targets for 2030 by the end of next year. That appears to be weaker than a previous version which used the word ""urges"" in the same sentence.What are the main points of contention?Some countries, including Britain, want the language on submitting more ambitious targets next year to be as strong as possible. China, which is responsible for 31 per cent of global emissions, wants loopholes under which it could claim it is already doing its fair share to reduce emissions in line with the Paris agreement.Developing nations most vulnerable to climate change want finance - a combination of loans and grants - from wealthy countries to help them adapt to the impacts of global warming and build renewable energy capacity rather than cheap coal plants as they develop their economies. They argue that the West has benefited from fossil fuels for more than two centuries and now, having done so, is expecting them to forgo them, while also coping with the effects of climate change largely created by richer countries.The latest text raps the knuckles of developed nations (or, in UN-language, it ""notes with deep regret"") for failing to provide the promised $100 billion in public and private climate finance each year from 2020.The text ""urges"" developed countries to at least double climate finance for adaptation measures. In 2019 only about a quarter of the $80 billion provided was for adaptation with the rest for schemes to cut emissions.It also contains a section on ""loss and damage"", which has long been an area of tortured negotiation. This involves an acknowledgement of the present effects of climate change being experienced, largely in the developing world - and, hence, its inclusion is an anchor on which future negotiations about compensation can pivot.Will the deal include a commitment to phase out fossil fuels?Perhaps the most contentious paragraph of all in the draft text relates to what is - ultimately - the entire point of the process: fossil fuels. An earlier draft of the text called on countries to ""accelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuel."" The new version has added two qualifiers that speak of hours of tortured discussion. The text now wants nations to accelerate the phase out of ""unabated"" coal power and of ""inefficient"" subsidies. That could allow countries to build new coal plants but claim at some point in future they will be low carbon because they have facilities, which might eventually be used, for capturing and storing carbon emissions. The addition of the word ""inefficient"" could allow countries to maintain their existing subsidies because they deem them to be ""efficient"".What are the other issues Cop26 is trying to resolve?Delegates are trying to agree on a ""rule book"" for carbon offsetting: this would allow wealthy nations to meet their climate targets partly by paying developing countries to take additional action that cuts emissions, such as restoring degraded forests. The rules are intended to prevent double counting of emissions targets by both the country where the emissions reduction project takes place and the country or company purchasing the offset. Brazil and other countries with old credits from a previous offset scheme want to carry them forward into the new one but there are concerns that such credits are ""hot air"" and giving them currency could actually increase overall emissions.Countries are also trying to agree rules on ""transparency"", or how they report on their emissions and progress in reducing them to give confidence to the rest of the world that they are meeting their pledges.What should we look for in revisions to the text as the day progresses?In the legal language of the draft document each clause begins with a verb and, as one NGO leader puts it, ""Verbs are so important"". ""The language, if you look at it, 'reiterates', 'urges', 'recognises', 'welcomes', 'acknowledges'. There is no 'commits' "". The strength of each verb, the normal linguistic fuzziness of which is defined by negotiators with exacting precision, determines whether paragraphs already in the text are priorities or mere lipservice.Specific language on phasing out fossil fuels has never before appeared in the closing text from a UN climate conference so if that sentence in the draft survives, even in weakened form, that UK team believes that will count as a success.",Copyright 2021 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper; Web Publication|WEBTTO|ENGLISH|CLIMATE CHANGECLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION & POLICYGLOBAL WARMINGWEATHERAGREEMENTSEMERGING MARKETSEMISSIONSGREEN FINANCEDEFORESTATIONEXTREME TEMPERATURESHEAT WAVESENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAIR QUALITY REGULATIONRENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRY|GLOBAL WARMINGEMISSIONSENERGY & UTILITIESGREEN FINANCEDEFORESTATIONENERGY & ENVIRONMENTRENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRYCOAL FIRED PLANTSCOAL INDUSTRY|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|CHINABRAZILSAUDI ARABIA",

145,"Don't be fooled by Cop26 boasts - emissions need cutting to zero, not net zero","November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),News,623,NEWS;Pg. 10,623,England & Wales,CAROLINE LUCAS,,ROYAL DUTCH SHELL PLC,ROYAL DUTCH SHELL PLC,"Don't be fooled by Cop26 boasts - emissions need cutting to zero, not net zero","There's been a lot of self-congratulation at Cop26 as more countries commit to net zero emissions. The boast is that more than 80 per cent of the global economy is now covered by a national net zero target.But that little word ""net"" is having to do an awful lot of heavy lifting. At best, there's too much reliance on it. At worst, it's an accountancy trick giving people the impression of climate action when in reality it's business as usual, with catastrophic consequences for people and planet.For a start, nearly all net zero pledges are for mid-century or beyond - whether they come from governments or corporations. That is far too late to respond to an accelerating climate emergency.Even the supposedly more ambitious pledges made in Glasgow bring us nowhere near the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global heating to 1.5C. The analysis from Climate Action Tracker is that we're currently heading for a catastrophic 2.4C rise in average global temperatures by the end of this century. We need urgent, deep cuts in emissions this decade, not a ""burn now, pay later"" approach.The other danger is what lies behind the net zero pledges. Where the focus should be on cutting emissions this decade, countries and corporations instead plan to continue burning fossil fuels for decades while claiming they're taking climate action with a range of tricks, often including untested technological innovations such as carbon removal schemes.Perhaps even worse, too many companies are taking the easier option of offsets like tree plantations, reforestation and afforestation when instead they should be transitioning away from fossil fuels altogether. Planting trees will not deliver the transformational change that we urgently need to prevent climate breakdown.No-one denies that we need to protect and grow more trees. But mass tree planting as a form of offsetting is leading to indigenous peoples in the global south being pushed off their ancestral land so that it can be planted with trees to allow a corporation in the global north to claim it is reaching net zero emissions.This needs to be called out for what it is: climate colonialism. People who are already suffering the worst impacts of the climate crisis despite having done least to cause it, now face having to pay twice to address it. Far from addressing climate injustice, this multiplies it.Nor is it a practical solution - the amount of land required for tree planting to offset emissions is almost unimaginable.Take just one example. The oil giant Shell says it plans to reach net zero by 2050, offsetting 120 million tonnes of CO2 by planting forests. According to ActionAid, the land required would be no less than 12 million hectares by 2030 - three times the size of the Netherlands. And all the while, Shell plans to continue investing in oil and gas exploration, pumping carbon into the atmosphere.Shell is just one of six oil majors in the world. There is simply not enough cultivable land for all these emissions to be offset by tree planting when that land is also needed to grow food and for biodiversity.It is a vast pretence, and a cover to allow corporations to carry on with their business as usual, polluting while claiming to be taking action on the climate crisis. So no more magic maths. Instead of relying on unproven and often untested technological innovations such as carbon removal schemes or tree planting, emissions have to be cut to real zero, not net zero. Nations and corporations which have done most to damage the climate need to take responsibility, be far more ambitious with emissions cuts and support those communities in the global south which are suffering the worst impacts.Caroline Lucas is the Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion",Copyright 2021 Independent Print Ltd All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|IA|ENGLISH|ROYAL DUTCH SHELL PLC|NAICS447110 GASOLINE STATIONS WITH CONVENIENCE STORESNAICS325110 PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURINGNAICS211130 NATURAL GAS EXTRACTIONNAICS211120 CRUDE PETROLEUM EXTRACTION|RDS.A (NYSE)RDS.A (LSE)RDS.A (EUR)|News|EMISSIONSCARBON NEUTRAL INITIATIVESCLIMATE CHANGENEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSAGREEMENTSCARBON OFFSETSGLOBAL WARMINGGLOBALIZATIONBUSINESS NEWSFORESTS & WOODLANDSECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORSTIMBER TRACT OPERATIONSREFORESTATIONINDIGENOUS PEOPLES|EMISSIONSCARBON NEUTRAL INITIATIVESENERGY & UTILITIESCARBON OFFSETSGLOBAL WARMINGOIL & GAS INDUSTRYFORESTRY & LOGGINGTIMBER TRACT OPERATIONSREFORESTATION|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|NETHERLANDS",RDS.A (NYSE)
146,Footsie giant pulls plug on car batteries;Setback for Britain's green future as Cop26 ends,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Scottish Daily Mail,News,567,NEWS;Pg. 81,567,"Scotland
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland",Francesca Washtell,,JOHNSON MATTHEY PLC,JOHNSON MATTHEY PLC,Footsie giant pulls plug on car batteriesSetback for Britain's green future as Cop26 ends,"BRITAIN'S ambition to become an electric car battery champion suffered a setback yesterday as Johnson Matthey abandoned a pioneering programme.The FTSE100 chemicals group said it would scrap years of research and development because it was too far behind foreign competitors in China and Korea who are already making batteries on a huge scale.The decision puts a question mark over 400 high-skilled jobs - most of which are in County Durham and Oxfordshire. Johnson Matthey's U-turn came as the company also said it would lose its chief executive of eight years, Robert MacLeod (pictured), and warned profits this year would be lower than some City estimates.The toxic cocktail of bad news sent Johnson Matthey shares into a tailspin.The stock tanked 19.1pc, or 527p, to 2236p, wiping £900m off the company's value.The news came at an awkward time for Boris Johnson, alerting the world to one of Britain's biggest companies admitting defeat in a key area of the race to go green as the Cop26 climate summit entered its final stages.Johnson Matthey makes most of its money from producing catalytic converters to filter exhaust emissions from petrol and diesel cars. Around one in three cars on the road worldwide are thought to have one of the company's converters attached.But looming bans on sales of traditional cars mean Johnson Matthey has been looking for new places to gain a foothold.It began its work on batteries in 2012 and had developed a technology called enhanced lithium nickel oxide, which enables electric cars to run for much longer than they can.Johnson Matthey, which traces its origins back 200 years to the industrial revolution, will now focus more on its work on hydrogen - which is expected to become another major growth area in the coming years.Car industry expert and Birmingham Business School academic David Bailey said: 'Battery production is all about scale and getting costs down - and Johnson Matthey wasn't able to do that. They've been at it a long time and thought they had a unique technology they could charge a premium for - that was the wrong bet and cost them dearly.'The announcement was a shock for the City after Johnson Matthey earlier this year earmarked £600m to invest in battery and hydrogen technologies, which many saw as a vote of confidence in the business. And six months ago MacLeod announced a decision to expand the electric battery division with a large facility in Finland. There are fears that Johnson Matthey's experience is a sign of more shocks to come for the UK industry.Bailey said: 'Johnson Matthey's announcement is a blow for the UK automotive industry.'The UK is lagging badly behind in terms of putting in place the electric battery production infrastructure needed to really be a serious competitor.'Nissan and its partner Envision recently unveiled plans to expand its giant battery-making 'gigafactory' in Sunderland as electric car demand has soared. Plans by another group, Britishvolt, to build a factory in the UK is still in the early stages.MacLeod, 57, will step down in February after almost eight years in the job. He will be succeeded by the head of Bayer's crop science unit, Liam Condon.MacLeod has staked much of his and the company's reputation on its electric battery tech.He said that while its products were a success, the group had concluded 'we will not achieve the return necessary to justify further investment'.",Copyright 2021 Associated Newpapers Ltd.

150,How has Cop26 shifted the dial on the climate crisis? A visual guide,"November 12, 2021 Friday",Non-jurisdictional,The Guardian (London),News,383,ENVIRONMENT;Version:1,383,,"Jonathan Watts, Pablo Gutiérrez, Ashley Kirk and Sen Clarke",,,,How has Cop26 shifted the dial on the climate crisis? A visual guide,"Cop26 will close without even one major economy aligned with keeping global heating to 1.5C, according to the world's most respected climate analysis coalition. A study of 36 countries by Climate Action Tracker  shows progress has been made at Glasgow, though not nearly enough to keep the world from dangerous levels of heating.Major emitters such as Europe, the US and China have increased their ambition compared with two years ago, but their emissions-cutting pledges remain insufficient to reach the Paris agreement's target. Other nations, including Brazil, Australia, Saudi Arabia and Russia, remain so far off course that they are pushing the planet towards 4C above pre-industrial levels.The total effect of countries' 2030 pledges and long-term targets will put the world on track for global warming of 2.1C by 2100.This represents a step forward, albeit with caveats. When Climate Action Tracker began analysing the effects of targets and pledges in 2009, it estimated the world was on course for 3.5C of heating. By the time the Paris agreement was adopted in 2016, this had fallen to 2.8C.After Donald Trump took power and began reversing US climate policies, the global outlook worsened to 3.2C. Advances at Glasgow, however, have taken it down to its lowest point, albeit still dangerously outside the Paris agreement targets, with time running out, and heavily dependant on long-term political promises that may or may not be fulfilled.A stricter assessment, which looks only at the impacts of near-term 2030 targets, projects the world to be on course for a disastrous 2.4C of warming - a figure that made headlines  earlier this week. The impact of Glasgow will not be determined by these projections. If negotiators can agree on a final statement, it should oblige nations to take more ambitious actions. The only metric that matters is whether emissions start to fall in the next couple of years.                   Methodology                   Source: Climate Action Tracker  and the World Bank.

151,"I'm open to bringing in congestion charges for NI drivers: Mallon;People need to cut journeys, minister declares at Cop26","November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Belfast Telegraph,News,552,NEWS;Pg. 20,552,Ireland,Andrew Madden,,,,"I'm open to bringing in congestion charges for NI drivers: MallonPeople need to cut journeys, minister declares at Cop26","INFRASTRUCTURE Minister Nichola Mallon has said she is open to the idea of introducing congestion charges in Northern Ireland's cities in a bid to cut emissions and move people away from private vehicles.Speaking to the Belfast Telegraph from the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow, the deputy SDLP leader also said her party is hoping to progress a bill through Westminster that would include 'green taxes' for large businesses in order to fund initiatives needed to meet environmental targets.Congestion charges are fees paid by drivers allowing them to drive in areas that experience heavy traffic volumes, typically city centres.Questioned about the possibility of introducing such charges here, the minister said: ""In June I published my Time for Change document, setting out a hierarchy of transport and travel, with walking and cycling at the top, sustainable public transport, and with private car use towards the bottom. In my view, we need to make people travel less.""A lot of people are making unnecessary journeys in the first place and, as a result of Covid, hybrid working will help with that. We also need to ensure we have safe infrastructure in place for people who want to cycle and I've introduced the £20m blue/ green fund, which is about promoting active travel and greenways. ""But I think we are going to have to look at incentivising people out of their cars and I am mindful that, in other places, they are looking at issues like parking charges and congestion charges. That would be an issue that would have to be brought to the Executive, but certainly I am open to considering a range of things. We're in the middle of a climate crisis and we need to be bold in our thinking.""On Wednesday, Ms Mallon signed the Glasgow Declaration, on behalf of the Executive. The declaration involves signatories agreeing that they will work towards all sales of new cars and vans being zero-emission vehicles by no later than 2035.With such initiatives requiring investment if they are to be achievable, Ms Mallon said SDLP leader Colum Eastwood is bring- ing forward a private member's bill at Westminster that includes measures to help this.""A key component of the bill is looking to the big companies, the big polluters, looking to see at how they can contribute through green taxes to pay to help us address the climate emergency. It is going to be costly as it is only right that those who have the biggest responsibility make the biggest contributions,"" she said.The Infrastructure Minister was also asked what she will take away from her time at the conference.""I was at an event yesterday where the Scottish Transport Minister Graeme Dey was saying that sometimes people think that because some places are small, they can't contribute a lot to climate action, but actually they can,"" she said.""In Northern Ireland we have opportunities that don't present themselves in other places, such as our publicly-owned public transport network and water provider.

152,Sturgeon appears to have had a selfie-tastic Cop26,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Metro (UK),News,198,FEATURES;Pg. 17,198,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,,,,Sturgeon appears to have had a selfie-tastic Cop26,"? It would be fair to say that so far during Cop26 first minister Nicola Sturgeon has been, shall we say, most keen to be seen with any and every political leader.It was quite embarrassing watching this at times, when she took on the appearance of an ardent teenage autograph hunter, or an ardent football fan seeking out her heroes for a selfie, not the political leader of a devolved region of the UK.But one figure of note at the conference she appears to have avoided is her fellow nationalist leader of the province of Quebec in Canada, Francois Legault. His party of course has lost two referendum attempts to break up Canada.Could it be that Ms Sturgeon did not want to be associated in any way with the failure of the Quebec nationalists? It certainly appears to have been the case. Alexander, EdinburghBru time: Nicola Sturgeon with US politician Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ? If the world's leaders were serious about saving the planet - particularly their bit of it - they would fine the loggers $1million for every acre of forest damaged and confiscate their equipment. The money could be ploughed into reforestation and to help the local indigenous populations.Sylvie Orp, Bromley",Copyright 2021 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

In the cold light of day, excuse the double meaning for the subject matter, it turned out to be a damp squib.As Cop26 droned on, attention shifted to the Prime Minister's UK problems away from the international stage.The subject of Tory sleaze eclipsed the elements and undermined everything the Government hoped to achieve, where a more fitting theme would have been Parliamentary Change, where nothing has hitherto changed.Sleaze dogged John Major's administration and cronyism dogged Tony Blair's, and when it comes to sanctimonious criticism there are a lot of back yards which need cleaning up, which is why the public have a contempt for politicians.Politics is in such an unmitigated mess that nobody will believe any purported solutions for Climate Change in governments.

She said her government was actively discussing joining the alliance. ""There are different categories of membership and therefore we're going through an assessment as to what category - if we did choose to join - would best suit our circumstances,"" she said.""It's not the easiest message for a country like Scotland that has a long history and a big oil and gas sector here to say that we must . . . move beyond oil and gas."" She added that ""we've got to do that in a way that is as fast as possible"" but does not leave the 100,000 workers in oil and gas stranded.",Copyright 2021 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved,,Newspaper; Web Publication|WEBTTO|ENGLISH|CLIMATE CHANGENEGATIVE NEWSENERGY & ENVIRONMENTGREEN ECONOMYNEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSRENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRYENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICEJOB CREATION|ENERGY & UTILITIESNATURAL GAS EXTRACTIONOIL & GAS INDUSTRYOIL & GAS EXTRACTIONENERGY & ENVIRONMENTGREEN ECONOMYRENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRYALTERNATIVE & RENEWABLE ENERGY|NICOLA STURGEONGRETA THUNBERG|SCOTLAND,

It was 2009, it was billed as a climate summit to save the world, and I was embedded with the protesters. They thought, quite rightly, that the world was not going to be saved.On the last day of that Cop they had something special planned. It was bitterly cold, and they were marching en masse to storm the conference hall. They were stopped and kettled long before that happened. On three sides were police with pepper spray and fierce Alsatians. On the fourth side was a canal, just above freezing. The conference hall was across the water.Eight of the British protesters took off their rucksacks and pulled out inflatable beds. Then, their breath misting in a light snowstorm, they blew them up, tied them together and pushed them on to the canal.Slowly, this pontoon bridge inched across.

I have balked at the private jets, the expensive pavilions, the delegates who met here when young and now in middle age reminisce about the Cops of their youth: Bali '07, Kyoto '97. Some have since got married; carbon dating, they call it.I went to Cop 18 (Doha '12), where on the night of the agreement - a non-binding agreement to reach a non-binding agreement in the future - I spent the early hours roaming the conference hall with a member of the British delegation who had heard a rumour that, in this dry country, the Russians had booze. They did, but weren't sharing.At the Rio Earth Summit +20, my most uplifting story was that a Nigerian delegation was staying in a ""love hotel"" whose room service menu included ""Penis grande com cinto"".Then, this year, I arrived at the Glasgow Cop to see that the Qatar stand - the stand of the country with the highest per capita emissions in the world - was especially popular because it had the best coffee. The Indonesian stand had the best food but a stern sign saying you had to listen to a talk before eating. The Tuvalu stand, just beyond it, inexplicably has a diorama of polar bears lynching a penguin.It is, as I say, easy to be cynical. In 30 years of Cops, of so many initiatives and agreements, of so many business-class flights to conference centres in attractive locations, there is a graph you can see of carbon concentration in the atmosphere.

I read, now, the reports from Copenhagen - and the corresponding assessment then was an apocalyptic 3.5 to 3.9C.So much feels the same. The same fatalism of NGOs, the same terrible agitprop theatre of protesters. But so much has changed. Three years ago 30 per cent of countries had net zero targets. Now, 90 per cent do. Ten years ago electric cars were milk floats. Now they are the luxury choice. Solar power costs pennies and is getting cheaper.Last month the US National Intelligence Council published its assessment of the state of the climate. It concluded 1.5C was to all intents and purposes not alive, but with one caveat. In its annexe, it pointed to the recent spike in private funding for nuclear fusion, ""a near endless source of energy"", and the possibility of a breakthrough in a technology that would be a genuine deus ex machina for the climate crisis.It is right to look at the messy sausage factory of Cop and be depressed. It is right, even righteous, to be angry. It is not right to be cynical. The pandemic taught us that humans are terrible at making sacrifices now for gains in the future.

On Wednesday, China and the US released a joint declaration on tackling climate change during the ongoing COP26 in Glasgow, including setting up a working group and reducing methane and CO2 emissions, marking a significant move on global climate actions and sending strong positive signals for the success of the COP26. China has made great contributions to global climate governance through its green development, participation in international negotiations, and multilateral cooperation. During the COP26, the Global Times (GT) reporters Shan Jie, Chen Qingqing and Zhao Yusha talked with Xu Huaqing (Xu), a senior expert from the Chinese delegation and director at the National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International Cooperation to understand China's position and expectations to the achievements of COP26. Photovoltaic power generation project in the field of a village in Nanning, South China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous RegionGT: What is China's main proposal and position at this conference?Xu: At COP26, based on the principles including common but differentiated responsibilities, developed countries should fulfil their promises as soon as possible, discuss the solutions of global energy transition and security jointly and make greater contributions to the global climate governance system.The first is to promote the fulfilment of finance commitments. Developed countries fulfilling the promise could be a key to COP26 success, which will help build confidence in the climate process. Though during COP26, US President Joe Biden said he would ""double funds by 2024 to $11.4 billion per year to help developing nations deal with climate change,"" to achieve success of COP26 in finance issues, other developed countries such as Australia, Canada, and the UK must promise to add an extra annual finance of $2-4 billion. It also called for the trust and support of African countries, the least-developed countries, and Alliance of Small Island States.The second is to explore ways of energy transition. China has vowed to strictly control the coal-energy projects and to support low-carbon development in developing countries, providing its solution to the international society. Although President Biden emphasized at the COP26 that the US will invest in clean energy in the recovery of the economy, he did not announce substantive measures. Similarly, the technical assistance initiative proposed by the COP26 chair country's Energy Transition Council neither listed financial and technical support required for the transition.Xu Huaqing, a senior expert from the Chinese delegation and director at the National Center for Climate Change Strategy and International CooperationGT: China's commitment and practice in cutting emissions is gaining global attention. US President Joe Biden has chided China for not ""showing up"" on the climate issue. Do you feel the pressure of some Western criticism and what is your response?Xu: Climate change is a severe challenge faced by the whole humanity. Since the industrial revolution, human activities, especially from developed countries have skyrocketed the amount of greenhouse emission and hastened global warming. Thus those countries were asked to lead the task of cutting emission by accords such as the Paris Agreement, and provide developing countries with finance and technology to help them deal with the task. Hence, US and other Western countries' criticism against China's actions and policies on climate change and China's achievement in this field, is arrogant, prejudicial and impractical. China has unwaveringly stuck to a green, low carbon and sustainable development path, and contributed China's wisdom and plan of tackling global warming to the world. The country's roadmap of hitting peak emissions before 2030 and for carbon neutrality by 2060 is way shorter than that of the developed world. The word ""before"" in those two goals reflected China's scientific respect toward future uncertainties, and the courage and responsibility of China as a responsible developing country. Plus, China also actively participated in the global governance of global warming. It played an active role in pushing forward the Paris Agreement, and looking forward to conduct dialogues with US and European countries. It also joined the South-South cooperation in helping developing countries improve their capacity of dealing with climate change. In a nutshell, China is an important participant, contributor, and leader of global ecological rebuilding and international cooperation on climate change. China is a developing country with 1.4 billion people. We also have the responsibility of improving people's lives. Currently, China's emissions per capita are only half those of the US, and cumulative historical carbon emissions per capita account for only one eighths of those by the US. Meanwhile, China, as a world factory, also bears large amounts of carbon emissions for other countries as it supplies commodities to other countries. The COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland Photo: VCGGT: Climate negotiations are always difficult, and it involves competition of interests. Western media and observers claim that there are not too many new goals or much new content in China's latest nationally determined contributions (NDCs). What are your thoughts on that?Xu: China recently submitted its updated nationally determined contributions with a number of specific targets such as peak emission, percentage of non-fossil fuel energy in energy consumption and installed capacity of renewable energy. Compared to the NDC submitted in 2015, the new targets on peak emission, decline in carbon emission intensity, and an increase of proportion of non-fossil fuel energy are much more ambitious in the latest NDC, with new added goals of total installed capacity of wind power and solar power to reach 1.2 billion kilowatts and above. The updated NDC is not only China's great contribution to global governance but also higher requirements for the country's work on combating climate change. To achieve these new goals, the updated NDC also clearly stated 13 new measures in reducing emissions such as promoting a comprehensive green transformation of economic and social development, advancing the green and low-carbon transformation in the industrial sector and building market-oriented mechanisms like carbon trading. We should also understand that China is facing huge challenges in reaching those NDC targets as a developing country with a population of 1.4 billion. Its also a country rich in coal but poor in oil and gas, which is now in a crucial period of transforming its development mode. And it will take more time to realize the energy restructuring as it is difficult to fundamentally change the coal-based energy structure in the short term. GT: Ahead of COP26, G20 leaders agreed on a 1.5C global warming target. How do you see this target? What does it mean for China? Xu: Like Xie Zhenhua, China Special Envoy for Climate Change, told media recently that China has never been opposed to the 1.5C target, which was also included in the Paris Agreement - a milestone in multilateral climate change cooperation. While it should understand that the long term goals set by the Paris Agreement require developed countries to set the example in reducing emissions, which is also the key to achieving a global zero emission target as soon as possible. Also, countries need to take strong concrete actions rather than making empty slogans.China's target to achieve carbon peaks by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060 in order to achieve the targets set by the Paris Agreement means that as the world's largest developing country, China will achieve the largest decline in carbon emission intensity in the shortest time in history. A polar bear Photo: AFPGT: The issue of funding for developing countries is also a much-debated issue. If we cannot meet the funding demands of developing countries, what impact will it have on COP26? What contribution has China made in South-South climate cooperation?Xu: Climate funding lays an important foundation for maintaining mutual political trust in the multilateral climate process and achieving the goals of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement. It is also a core concern of developing countries. At present, developed countries have still not fulfilled the political commitment of providing $100 billion in climate funding to developing countries each year made by the Copenhagen Climate Conference, and the public funds provided by themselves account for a relatively low proportion, which is difficult to meet the funding demand of developing countries in dealing with climate change.Developed countries should fill the $100 billion annual climate funding gap before 2020 as soon as possible, create a positive and constructive atmosphere for the success of COP26, and make concrete efforts to maintain mutual political trust among all parties and the seriousness of the multilateral climate process.This $100 billion should also be a starting point for developed countries to further sustainably increase the funding of climate actions to meet the demand of developing countries' efforts and improve the traceability as well as the transparency of climate funds.",Copyright 2021 Global Times.

Fake parking infringement notices that branded the four-wheel-drive cars a ""climate violation"" have been left on about 60 vehicles in the city's West End district.Pharmacist Jamie MacConnacher discovered the two front tyres of his Land Rover  had been deflated on Thursday morning.He told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme that several other cars in the area had been targeted.He said: ""I don't think targeting individuals that have these vehicles is the right way to do it. They don't know what the reason for somebody having that car is.""                     NEW: activists have deflated the tires of around 60 4X4s in a Glasgow's west end in protest at the cars high levels of emissions. according to the International Energy Agency SUVS were the 2nd largest contributor to the increase in global carbon emissions after power 2010-2018 pic.twitter.com/FsDLLO37Gq - huck (@HUCKmagazine) November 11, 2021 Mr MacConnacher said he needs his Land Rover to drive to his job as a pharmacist 25 miles to Aberfoyle in Stirlingshire, and because he often drives through ""challenging conditions"" in winter.He said the flat tyres made him 45 minutes late for work, but added that the consequences could have been ""quite significant"" for his patients, a number of whom are at the end of their lives in palliative care.Mr MacConnacher added: ""I understand that there is a need for change, I'm totally for that. I would have an electric car but it's the logistics in the West End of Glasgow. There's nowhere to charge outside your flat so it just doesn't work for me.""A flyer left on Mr MacConnacher's vehicle said his car was ""driving the climate breakdown"", mainly in poor countries.Lawyer Victoria Young vented her frustration over her front tyre being completely deflated.She tweeted: ""To the idiots who did this to my car as I'm trying to get to Paisley High Court this morning, did it ever occur to you that the driver might have to use their vehicle in an emergency? It's being reported to @PoliceScotland.""To the idiots who did this to my car as I'm trying to get to Paisley High Court this morning, did it ever occur to you that the driver might have to use their vehicle in an emergency? It's being reported to @PoliceScotland pic.twitter.com/TJ0jOET3hl - Victoria J Young (@VictoriaJYoung2) November 11, 2021A number of other social media users questioned whether the activists could tell if any of the 4x4 cars ran on fuel, electricity, or were hybrid models.Activist group Tyred of SUVs - part of Glasgow Calls Out Polluters - claimed responsibility, saying they had deflated tyres of around 60 vehicles in the ""rich neighbourhood"".The group said that no tyres were damaged in the action.They added, according to the BBC: ""If 4x4 drivers were a nation, they'd be the seventh biggest polluters on the planet (Source: International Energy Agency). If the 1% won't take responsibility for the climate destruction they wreak, we'll make them.""Fin, a member of Tyred of SUVs, told BBC Radio Scotland: ""This is a minor inconvenience that is not going to disrupt them in a huge way. What is really going to disrupt people's lives and kill them is the climate crisis caused by rich people - basically SUV owners.""Police Scotland said the force is aware of the incidents and that it has increased patrols in Glasgow's West End.

162,Fossil fuel companies owe reparations to countries they are destroying,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Guardian (London),News,814,ENVIRONMENT;Version:1,814,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Mark Hertsgaard,,EXXON MOBIL CORP,EXXON MOBIL CORP,Fossil fuel companies owe reparations to countries they are destroying,"Mohammed Nasheed made global headlines in 2009 by convening the world's first underwater cabinet meeting. As president of the Maldives, a nation of 1,138 low-lying islands south-west of India, Nasheed donned scuba gear and descended beneath the waves with 13 government ministers. The officials used waterproof pencils to sign a document urging the world to slash carbon dioxide emissions so the Maldives would not disappear beneath rising seas.""If the Maldives cannot be saved today, we do not feel that there is much of a chance for the rest of the world,"" Nasheed told reporters.Today, Nasheed is the speaker of parliament in the Maldives and the global south's ambassador to the Cop26 climate conference. He continues to warn that anything more than 1.5C of global warming ""is a death sentence"" for his country and other low-lying regions around the world. To illustrate what the last 12 years of rising temperatures have brought, he recalls the lagoon where he held that famous underwater cabinet meeting.""If you go to the same spot [today], you will see the reef is far more dead, bleached, than it was,"" Nasheed said in Glasgow this week. Dead reefs lead to coastal erosion, which wipes out homes and schools and contaminates freshwater sources; the Maldives now spends 30% of its government budget adapting to climate change, including vast sums to desalinate water, he added.These are some of the human realities behind ""loss and damage,"" a phrase suddenly in vogue at this week's Cop26 UN climate conference. It refers to irreversible harms that result from the higher global temperatures caused by burning fossil fuels and related human activities. The dead reefs of the Maldives, for example, will never come back to life as long as oceans are so hot - they will remain bleached for decades to come, even if countries manage to limit temperature rise to 1.5C.It's scandalous it has taken so long for global climate negotiations to acknowledge the reality of ""loss and damage"". Worse yet, even now, Cop26 proceedings are not calling on the main authors of the climate emergency - ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, BP, and other fossil fuel companies - to pay for the immense human suffering and economic harm they have caused.""The principle is easy enough: these companies have to admit they are responsible for loss and damage, and they should pay for it,"" said Saleemul Huq, the director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development in Bangladesh.The formal absence of calls for compensation from fossil fuel companies is not surprising at Cop26; a first draft of the conference's agreement did not even include the words ""fossil fuels"" (though a later draft does reference the need to phase out coal and subsidies for fossil fuels). Instead, Cop26's discussion assumes governments of wealthy countries will cover the costs. Here, too, the reasoning is straightforward: rich countries have emitted the vast majority of the gases overheating the planet, so they should pay for the resulting harm.Paying for loss and damage, however, is not a proposition most rich country governments have embraced. Scotland is a shining exception: Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, announced on Thursday that Scotland will provide £3m for loss and damage, an example she urged other nations to follow. Meanwhile, rich countries are still lagging on a related obligation they have  accepted: providing poorer countries $100bn a year to shift to clean energy and adapt to worsening impacts.But adaptation is distinct from loss and damage. ""Adaptation is what people do to protect themselves,"" for example, desalinating water, said Simon Anderson of the International Institute for Environment and Development. ""Loss and damage is what happens to people, with or without adaptation.""As the Climate Vulnerable Forum's ambassador to Cop26, Nasheed says loss and damage could determine the conference's success or failure. ""I call on the companies to pay for the damage that's been done, and for governments to make them pay,"" he said of the fossil fuel industry. ""Unless they do that, it will be tough to get the confidence of vulnerable countries that these talks are meaningful.""In a just world, the executives of fossil fuel companies would have to change places with people in the Maldives and experience how it feels to lose the reefs that protect their homes, schools, fresh water, and what Nasheed called ""2,000 years of culture"". Short of that, doesn't simple morality demand that the companies pay for the massive loss and damage they have wrought?

163,"From climate change to Taliban's murderous repression of women, virtue signalling on Twitter can hide lack of real action – Susan Dalgety","November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Scotsman,News,1014,COLUMNISTSPOLITICSWORLDNATIONALSCOTLAND,1014,Scotland,Susan DalgetyN/A,,TWITTER INC,TWITTER INC,"From climate change to Taliban's murderous repression of women, virtue signalling on Twitter can hide lack of real action – Susan Dalgety","More than 2,000 ago, Cicero, the great Roman orator, wrote that the three aims of political speech-making were: docere, delectare, et movere. Prove your argument, please your audience, and move them emotionally.Winston Churchill was a master at the art. His emotive radio speeches inspired the British people during the darkest moments of the Second World. He “mobilised the English language and sent it into battle,” declared President John F Kennedy in 1963, himself no stranger to the power of carefully crafted imagery in politics.This last fortnight, we have witnessed our First Minister use social media to sell Scotland – some would say promote herself – on the world stage. At the time of writing, she has posted or retweeted 84 images of herself at COP26 – that’s more than seven a day, far more than my teenage grandson has ever managed.There was Nicola with David Attenborough. Nicola with Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nicola with Joe Biden, and of course Nicola with Greta Thunberg, the young Swedish climate activist, which prompted Friends of the Earth Scotland to criticise her approach.“Nicola Sturgeon… is keen to be photographed with Greta Thunberg, but at some point her fine rhetoric has to translate into a commitment to stopping oil and gas production…” said their director Richard Dixon.My own particular favourite from Nicola’s COP26 folder was of her with another doyen of social media, US congresswoman, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, or @AOC to her 12.7 million Twitter followers.READ MORE: COP26 climate change summit: World is acting too slowly on global warming – Royal Society, US National Academy of Sciences and South African Academy of ScienceResplendent in a red trouser suit and killer heels – the perfect costume for an impromptu selfie – the First Minister was snapped handing AOC a soft drink. “Amidst all of the serious business at #COP26 today, I’m pleased to also report that @AOC now has a supply of Irn-Bru,” she tweeted.“I don’t pose with anybody,” the First Minister said later in response to criticism of her COP26 media strategy, but the 84 pieces of evidence make her denial ring hollow. That said, I have some sympathy with Sturgeon.Cicero made one of his most famous speeches on the Palatine Hill in the centre of Rome. Churchill used the radio to get his message across. Sturgeon is simply using today’s medium – social media – as her platform. She is a 21st-century politician using 21st-century mass communication techniques, and she does it quite effectively.Therein lies the problem, because dig below the surface of Sturgeon’s Twitter feed and there is very little substance. She tweets a good game, but virtue-signalling soundbites are not the same as delivery.Friends of the Earth criticised the First Minster, not because she got her picture taken with a climate change activist, but because Scotland – an oil-rich nation – does not have a representative at the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, launched by Denmark and Costa Rica to halt new drilling.And on Thursday, Sturgeon could not even tear herself away long enough from her COP26 photo shoot to attend the weekly First Minister’s Questions, sending her long-suffering deputy John Swinney instead. He had to field questions about why a 55-year-old-man, Richard Brown, died alone on his tenement stair after waiting five hours for an ambulance.Scotland’s NHS is in crisis. The pandemic is not over. Our economy teeters on the brink of high inflation, yet the First Minister’s response is to tweet another hashtag.But we are all guilty of confusing a like on Twitter with political progress. Don’t get me wrong, social media can be a very effective campaign tool. In recent years, I have met some amazing feminists online, but it cannot replace action in real life.When the Taliban stormed to power in Afghanistan in August, world leaders warned them not to persecute women and girls. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken tweeted, “… we call on those in positions of power and authority across Afghanistan to guarantee the protection of women and girls and their rights. We will monitor closely how any future government ensures their rights and freedoms.”Global campaigner Malala Yousafzai, herself a survivor of Taliban violence, wrote, “… I am deeply worried about women, minorities and human rights advocates. Global, regional and local powers must call for an immediate ceasefire, provide urgent humanitarian aid and protect refugees and civilians.”Yet within weeks, the world’s attention had turned away to the next social media sensation, just as the Taliban began to tighten their grip. Girls over 12 were forbidden from getting an education. A few days ago, the bullet-ridden body of women’s activist Frozan Safi was found in northern Afghanistan, and another three women were murdered in similar circumstances.In an emotional radio interview earlier this week, veteran BBC journalist John Simpson warned of an impending food crisis in the country.David Beasley, executive director of the World Food Programme told Simpson: “We're now looking at the worst humanitarian crisis on Earth. Ninety-five per cent of the people don't have enough food… 23 million people marching towards starvation.” And parents are now selling their young daughters for ‘marriage’ in return for money for food, as CNN reported last week. But Afghanistan is no longer trending.Our world has never been more connected. Our politicians can, and some do, speak to us several times a day via social media. We can campaign on any topic that moves us from the comfort of our sitting rooms. But the danger is that it is all a performance, from Sturgeon’s selfies to our own ‘likes’ of heart-breaking headlines. We are tweeting while the world is burning.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this article.

164,Hot air in Glasgow means it's time for radical leadership': Read full letter signed by more than 200 academics,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),News,601,"CLIMATE,NEWS;Version:1",601,England & Wales,,,,,Hot air in Glasgow means it's time for radical leadership': Read full letter signed by more than 200 academics,"Earlier this year, the official international summary of climate science  announced we face increasing disasters and disruptions, with the most vulnerable suffering the most and soonest. A leaked report  from the same UN process identified the need for a transformation in our economic systems for a meaningful attempt to limit loss and damage.Yet at the COP26  climate summit in Glasgow , no plan for a justice-based economic transformation was launched. Worse, voluntary business commitments distracted from the economic policies necessary to reduce atmospheric carbon and prepare for worsening disruption. That is despite decades of voluntary initiatives not delivering  significant impacts on the climate. It is both unscientific and unethical to deny that our economic system is at fault , so must be transformed to reduce climate risk and adapt to the difficulties. To ignore that reality, plans are afoot to waste huge sums of money on energy-hungry yet atmospherically insignificant carbon capture machines. Political leaders could instead level with their populations about necessary changes in industries and lifestyles. Respecting climate justice, they could take immediate steps to reduce inequality both nationally and globally - key for any changes in livelihoods to be fair and lasting.We are hundreds of scholars from dozens of countries, who are grieving the situation but determined not to ignore it. We believe that the corporate capture and failure of COP26 clearly show that people in communities and organisations must now lead our own emergency response. That includes coordinated radical policy advocacy from outside of a corporate-driven system, for a Real Green Revolution  that will significantly reduce and drawdown emissions, regenerate nature and help us adapt. It also includes growing community-led Deep Adaptation  efforts independently of governments and transnational corporations.The hot air from Glasgow means it's time for more honest and radical leadership. We must call out the fantasy that dangerous global heating will not get worse or that the largest corporations will come to our rescue. When we escape such delusion, we can contribute to a different way forward - one we hope governments will join when they escape the constraints of business-as-usual.SignedDr Malika Virah-Sawmy, IAAS-Potsdam, Germany and MauritiusProfessor Dr Jem Bendell, University of Cumbia and co-editor Deep Adaptation, UKDr Yves Cochet, Former Minister of the Environment, France, Institut Momentum, FranceProfessor Eva Lantsoght, Professor, Universidad San Francisco de Quito, EcuadorProfessor William Rees, Professor Emeritus Ecological Economics, University of British Columbia, USADr Aurelien Barrau, Professor of Astrophysics, Universite Grenoble-Alpes, FranceProfessor Yin Paradies, Professor of Race Relations, Deakin University, AustraliaDr Rupert Read, University of East Anglia, UKDr Igor Polskiy, board member, GEN-Russia, RussiaDr Carola Kloeck, Assistant professor, Sciences Po Paris, FranceDr Lajos Brons, Adjunct Professor of Philosophy, Lakeland University Japan, JPDr Morgan Phillips, Director, The Glacier Trust, UKA full list of all 200+ signatories can be found here.

The United Nations environmental agency UNEP calculates that the world's transport sector is almost entirely dependent on fossil fuels.But this\xa0could change in the coming decades.At COP26, over 100 national governments, cities, states and major businesses signed the\xa0Glasgow Declaration on Zero-Emission Cars and Vans\xa0to end the sale of internal combustion engines by 2035 in leading markets in 2040 worldwide.\xa0 At least 13 nations also committed to end the sale of fossil fuel powered heavy duty vehicles by 2040.Local efforts are also underway, with Latin-American cities, including Bogota, Cuenca and Salvador, aiming to transform to zero-emissions public transport fleets by 2035.""The message for decision makers is: We need to make sure that we start normalizing that by 2035, we must stop selling petrol and diesel cars. For buses, it's going to be earlier, 2030; heavy trucking, can give some time, 2040.The point is getting used to the idea of having a calendar so we can shift to zero emission options in all segments. This is not just for advanced markets in developed countries, it's also for developing economies because we know the worst pollution is there"", said Monica Araya from the global initiative\xa0Drive Electric Campaign.Ms. Araya was very clear that during the transition,\xa0developing countries must not become the dumping grounds for old technology from the richest ones, and instead they should be seen as drivers of transformational change.""I grew up in Costa Rica. I do remember going to school on a third hand bus imported from the US. That experience shaped a lot of my thinking around this transition. I know, on the one hand, we have to make sure we transform the big markets that produce trucks, buses, cars, (but we also) have to activate changes in those markets so there are ripple effects,"" she explained.A green shipping industryThe shipping industry also made moves today with 200 businesses from across the shipping value chain committing to scaling and commercializing zero-emission shipping vessels and fuels by 2030. They also called on governments to get the right regulations and infrastructure in place to enable a just transition by 2050.Meanwhile, 19 countries signed the\xa0Clydebank Declaration\xa0to support the\xa0establishment of zero-emission shipping routes.\xa0This means creating at least six zero-emission maritime corridors by the middle of this decade, while aspiring to see many more in operation by 2030.""There's about 50,000 merchant ships out there in the world so it is a large task at hand, and I think different parts of shipping will move at different paces. So, having the commitment of the\xa0Clydebank Declaration\xa0for green corridors enables first movers to trial and prove technology then bring down costs, create the policy, enable the ecosystems that are needed, and then others can learn from that and then follow"", Katharine Palmer, a UN Climate Change High-Level Champion, explained to UN News.These green corridors mean the ships that transport goods all over the world would travel without using hydrocarbon fuels and instead would use fuels derived from green hydrogen – hydrogen generated by renewable energy – renewable electricity and other sustainable options.""It also includes engaging with energy producers so\xa0they can produce enough (green) fuel.\xa0A public-private collaboration with governments [will also be needed] to put out the necessary policy,"" the expert added.In other good news, nine big-name brands including Amazon, IKEA, Michelin, Unilever and Patagonia announced that by 2040, they plan to shift 100 per cent of their ocean freight to vessels powered by zero-carbon.Aviation industry businesses and large corporate customers also announced an update of their\xa0Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition,\xa0whose mission is to accelerate the deployment of sustainable aviation fuels.Now, 80 signatories have committed to boost the green fuel to 10 per cent of the global jet fuel demand by 2030.These 'green fuels' are produced from\xa0sustainable feedstock such as cooking oil, palm waste oil from animals or plants, and solid waste from homes and business, and are very similar in chemistry to traditional fossil jet fuel.If achieved, this will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 60 million tonnes a year and provide around 300,000 'green' jobs.But what about solar or electric? According to Lauren Uppink, head of Aviation at the World Economic Forum, these power sources might be possible for short flights in the future.""There will be a small portion of the energy demand that will rely on new technology like hydrogen and battery, but long haul is\xa0not feasible for the physics of it.\xa0So sustainable aviation fuels are our only solution for decarbonizing and flying carbon neutral,"" she told UN News.The expert also announced that the first electric and hydrogen fueled planes will possibly start being deployed by 2030, and the transition of the industry could also generate thousands of green jobs in developing countries.The COP26 draft agreement text is releasedBeyond transport, the other big news at the conference on Wednesday was that the COP26 draft agreement was published by the Presidency, a preview of the final outcome document of the conference when it wraps up on Friday.The document urges countries to strengthen their national commitments and submit their strategies for their net-zero plans by 2022\xa0to keep the 1.5C goal within reach.It also includes, for the first time in a COP outcome text, a mention of 'loss and damage', as well as a call to end fossil fuels subsidies.""The eyes of the world are very much on us. So, I will ask you to rise to the challenge"", Alok Sharma, COP26 President, told negotiators during an informal plenary.""We have all shifted gears this week as we seek to accelerate the pace and I still have the intention to finish COP26 at the end of Friday, this Friday for clarity!"" he said, sparking some nervous laughter in the room (COP negotiations are known for spilling over beyond their official day).Later in the day, Sharma told journalists that the text, drafted by his office, will change and evolve as countries begin to engage in the details but the commitment to accelerate action this decade must be ""unwavering"".""I want to be clear:\xa0We are not seeking to reopen the Paris Agreement.\xa0The Paris Agreement clearly sets out the temperature goal well below 2 degrees and pursuing efforts to 1.5 degrees,"" he said, adding that the presidency is aiming to chart a path across the three main pillars of Paris: finance, adaptation and mitigation.He said getting to the final draft of the text would be a 'challenging' task but stressed that there is a lot at risk if an ambitious outcome is not reached.""Everyone knows what's at stake in this negotiation. What we agree in Glasgow will set the future for our children and grandchildren, and we know nobody wants to fail them,"" he told journalists.Sharma cited Prime Minister of Barbados Mia Motley's words last week: ""Two degrees for her country and many others is a death sentence"".""We are fighting tooth and nail so that we have an ambitious outcome, and I have reminded negotiators that world leaders set out ambition last week and we need to deliver. [If that doesn't happen] the negotiators and world leaders are going to have to look people in their countries and other countries in the eye and explain why we didn't get this one over the line,"" he underscored.Civil society: 'A text that creates an illusion of action is worse than no text at all'Members of the NGO Climate Action Network said that they welcomed the first mention ever of ""loss and damage"" recognizing that communities dealing with the challenges of rebuilding and recovering after climate disasters need the support of the world to do so but said that the text's words were just ""fluff"".""When it comes down to it, they will make no difference to the communities, to the small holder farmers, to the women and girls in the Global South.\xa0This text will still not do anything for those who have been hit the hardest by deadly flooding, cyclones, droughts, rising sea levels,""\xa0said Teresa Anderson of Climate Policy Coordinator of Actionaid International.Indeed, she said the text was yet more empty rhetoric, and that merely calling the situation ""urgent"" means nothing without a real commitment to action.""If COP26 doesn't match its recognition of urgency with real action to address it, to meet the needs of the people in the frontlines of the crisis, then it will be an empty vessel. A text that creates the illusion of action is arguably worse than no text at all,"" Ms. Anderson declared, and added that the people of the world were sick and tired of ""all this pretense"" and of ""leaders sitting on their hands…while devastation is heading our way.""She said world leaders need to ""go back and get it right by referencing all fossil fuels – not just coal – and by recognizing equity, by demanding more of the biggest polluters, and linking the call to action with finance for developing countries,"" she added.Finally, she said net-zero promises are a myth used by polluters and governments to lure people into a false sense of security that the climate crisis is being addressed.""If you scratch the surface of a net zero target, you'll likely search in vain for the radical systemic transformation\xa0in energy, food, transport, and industrial systems that are so urgently needed to ensure a livable planet"", Ms. Anderson said.The activist told journalist that with the draft outcome document leaders are 'still failing us"" with empty words that are not on target to meet the scale of the ""enormous challenge facing humanity.""""Where is the support to help people forced to pick up the pieces from climate disasters? Where is the action to meet all this urgency? And where are the commitments to limit global warming or to back up climate finance?"" she concluded.Greta Thunberg and other youth activists announced on Twitter that they sent a letter to the United Nations filing a legal petition to the UN Secretary-General urging him to declare a system-wide climate emergency, which would allow him to send resources and staff to countries most susceptible to climate change disasters.",Copyright 2021 The News Chronicle.

167,Big business and Cop26Are the 'net zero' plans credible?;Emissions-cutting plans do not oblige many to change their behaviour in the near future,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Irish Times,News,2396,FINANCE;Pg. 6,2396,Ireland,"Andrew Edgecliffe-Johnson, Simon Mundy",,BANK OF AMERICA CORP,BANK OF AMERICA CORPASTRAZENECA PLC,Big business and Cop26Are the 'net zero' plans credible?Emissions-cutting plans do not oblige many to change their behaviour in the near future,"With the greatest respect, Britain's Prince Charles told world leaders at the Cop26 summit last week, the private sector offered the only prospect of achieving the fundamental economic overhaul needed to avert a climate disaster.The heir to the British throne was in Glasgow to bestow some royal favour on businesses he saw leading that change - companies as diverse as AstraZeneca, Bank of America, IBM and L'Oréal. His patronage came in the form of the Terra Carta Seal, an award created by former Apple designer Sir Jony Ive that features oak leaves, honey bees and a monarch butterfly.The party at which Prince Charles mingled with chief executives captured a congratulatory mood at Cop26 among some of the world's largest businesses, many of which have used the summit to advertise fresh sustainability initiatives.But the regal validation was paired with a harsher critique from others at the summit - that many companies' emissions-cutting plans do not oblige them to change their behaviour any time soon or hold senior executives accountable for realising them. Some companies, the critics charge, are also engaged in hypocritical lobbying that is undermining the climate action they claim to want to see.For growing numbers of environmental activists, regulators and multilateral organisations, the voluntary steps companies have taken so far have had nowhere near the impact needed to steer humanity's course away from climate catastrophe.Indeed, some in Glasgow argued, the focus on voluntary corporate action risks weakening the drive for badly needed government policy interventions. Such concerns are driving pressure for the next chapter of the corporate response to climate change to be marked by fewer parties and press releases and by more verifiable standards, mandatory reporting and meaningful carbon prices.""Their main goal at Cop is to emerge as undisrupted as possible,"" Pat Brown, founder of the alternative protein start-up Impossible Foods, says of both the business and political elites gathered in Glasgow. Instead, he warned, ""what is needed is radical change - and fast"".Companies are not formally part of the Conference of the Parties meetings, which are reunions of countries that signed the 1994 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. But this year's summit was swarming with executives and their consultants, crowding out campaigners and even national delegates from Glasgow's overfull hotels.Corporate crowd The corporate crowd jetted in with a self-assured message for politicians: that business has been leading the way on climate action and it is high time that governments catch up. The International Chamber of Commerce told governments to ""wake up"" to the risk that their patchwork of carbon pricing regimes could slow progress on cutting emissions.The US Business Roundtable and its counterparts in Europe, Australia, Canada and Mexico told world leaders that companies could not ""shoulder the burden alone"" of investing in new clean energy technologies and needed better co-ordination between countries. Companies were now the ones asking for more ambitious climate action and saying ""for God's sake, do something about it"", Francesco Starace, chief executive of Enel, told Fortune.The message from some politicians at Cop26 was not much different. ""It's bankers that are now deciding. You have major corporate America factoring in the price of carbon. It matters,"" US president Joe Biden said.In the years after Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, pulled the US out of the Paris climate accord, US companies embraced the idea they were filling a void left by Washington by voluntarily setting ""net zero"" targets to cut their greenhouse gas emissions in line with the goals of that agreement, or offset any they could not eliminate.The Business Roundtable, for example, argued in September that the country had made significant progress towards reducing emissions ""in part because of corporate leadership in the absence of a smart, national climate policy"".Corporate America is far from unique in this, however. A recent survey of global chief executives by Accenture and the UN Global Compact found that just 18 per cent believe that governments have given them the clarity they need to set goals in line with a 1.5 degree warming trajectory.While some global business leaders are embracing the opportunity to help drive the new economic agenda, others such as Joachim Wenning, chief executive of reinsurance giant Munich Re, feel a growing sense of unease.""Very often I've heard things like 'in the absence of governments doing their job . . . we the private sector, we the economic leaders, have to take care of combating climate change'. It's almost: 'Then we have to replace the governments,'"" Wenning said. ""I think it's an illusion. It's not only that we don't have the mandate. We don't have the means, honestly.""Empty pledges The flood of pledges before and during Cop26 suggests that the pace of corporate climate action is accelerating. One in three of the largest public companies in G20 countries now has a net-zero target, up from one in five last year, according to an international research initiative called the Net Zero Tracker.In the UK, nearly half of the members of the FTSE 100 have set net-zero goals, while mentions of net zero in corporate reports have increased by 370 per cent in two years, according to Datamaran, an ESG analytics company.Behind the marketing materials, though, some of those pledges are less promising than they seem. Just one in five of the G20-based companies which have set emissions-cutting goals have aligned them with keeping temperatures to within 1.5 degrees of pre-industrial levels by 2050, according to the non-profit Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), and the rate falls to just 6 per cent outside G7 countries.Similarly of the 412 US companies in the US Russell 1000 index which have pledged to emit less, just 65 have set goals in line with that 1.5 degrees target, according to Just Capital, which tracks businesses' impact on society.According to a new MSCI report, companies' current emissions plans are still putting the globe on track for warming of 3 degrees. That is alarming many of the people who believe most ardently in the central role companies can play in responding to climate change.""We are very concerned about the credibility of all the targets out there,"" says Lila Karbassi, chief of programmes at the UN Global Compact, the UN's voluntary corporate sustainability network, which is a partner in SBTi.One problem is that many companies are pledging to hit those targets in almost three decades' time without committing to action for which they can be held accountable in the short term, says Austin Whitman, chief executive of Climate Neutral, a non-profit organisation that helps brands cut their emissions.""I think we are taking far too much comfort from the fact that companies are making these commitments for 2050,"" he says, arguing that companies should quantify what they plan to do in the nearer term. ""There's a reality that if you're making a 2050 pledge you really don't have to change anything today.""Another source of friction and suspicion is that many corporate net zero plans foresee continuing to emit greenhouse gases while purchasing carbon offsets to compensate. Critics increasingly question the true benefits of the forestry projects on which most such credits are based, claiming that in many cases they are dramatically overstated. Carbon-credit scam Through this unregulated market with wildly variable standards, some researchers warn, companies are able to claim carbon neutrality on paper while continuing to heat the planet in practice.""A lot of private institutions want to direct money into carbon offsets and say that this is the answer to the climate crisis. Really, it's just an excuse to keep emitting. They're getting pushed into a corner and they're just looking for an escape,"" says Mitzi Jonelle Tan, a Manila-based activist and prominent member of Fridays for Future, the climate movement spearheaded by Greta Thunberg.Without hard standards or regulations currently governing the carbon market, says Impossible Foods' Brown, ""any scammer can create and sell carbon credits. It makes the value of that system approximately zero.""Even the UN secretary-general, António Guterres, has joined the chorus of concern, warning of ""a deficit of credibility and a surplus of confusion over emissions reductions and net zero targets, with different meanings and different metrics"".A push for more meaningful standards for reporting climate action may be a harbinger of the more rigorous scrutiny companies can expect their climate-focused initiatives to face. After SBTi released a new voluntary standard for corporate net-zero targets last month, which pushes companies to focus on decarbonisation rather than offsets, the UN Global Compact said on Wednesday that more than 1,000 companies with a combined market value of over $23 trillion had committed to abide by it.Even so, Karbassi says clearer rules would also be needed. ""We need full-speed voluntary [action], full-speed regulation [and] more scrutiny around transparency,"" she says. ""I think it's going to become a societal expectation that you have a credible net-zero standard, and it's going to be an expectation from investors.""A broader push to standardise how companies account for their social and environmental impact also looks likely to usher in an era of mandatory reporting that will leave the fight against climate change less reliant on companies opting to take the initiative.In the UK, companies will be required to report their climate risks from 2022, following guidelines from the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. The IFRS Foundation's launch this month of an International Sustainability Standards Board is seen as the first step in bringing the rigour of mandatory financial reporting to previously voluntary and vague environmental and social impact disclosures.'Passionate speeches'Companies overwhelmed with competing environmental, social and governance initiatives have mostly welcomed such attempts at standardisation, while a group of investors with $4.5 trillion under management has said they plan to vote against the reappointment of auditors that do not ensure clients' climate pledges are credible.But the calls from business leaders at Cop26 for more action from governments jar with the way many of them have greeted attempts to reduce emissions through regulation or taxation.""They give passionate speeches then turn around and are either not investing much or are actively lobbying against"" what they claim to favour, says Climate Neutral's Whitman.Jussi Pesonen, chief executive of the Finnish pulp and paper company UPM, summed up the mood of many European executives this summer when he told analysts that he hoped policymakers would focus on ""green growth"" rather than ""regulation, limitation and taxation"".Industry groups pushed back on several elements of the European Commission's legislation for reducing emissions this summer, according to Influence Map, a London-based environmental group.Environmental activists have similarly accused the US Chamber of Commerce and other trade associations of undermining climate policies in Washington, including measures in the ""build back better"" Bill Biden has championed, which business fears would be funded with higher corporate taxes.""What you have heard at this Cop from corporate America is very different than what we in Congress hear from corporate America through corporate trade associations,"" noted Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democratic senator from Rhode Island who joined the US delegation in Glasgow.""The corporate members who made big promises here at this Cop have got to get their trade associations under control so they're not undercutting our work in Congress,"" he warned.That work has also been undercut by a centrist Democrat from a state whose economy depends heavily on the coal industry. Joe Manchin, the West Virginia senator, has already opposed the Clean Energy Performance Programme in Biden's spending package which would pay utilities to move away from fossil fuels.Reputational risks Despite groups including the US Business Roundtable calling on Cop26 leaders to implement an ""effective and fair"" carbon pricing system, Manchin also says that a carbon price ""is not on the board"".But a serious carbon-pricing system would be a uniquely powerful tool in building a low-carbon market economy, according to business leaders such as Wenning of Munich Re.""A sufficiently painful carbon price would trigger the market mechanisms that will indirectly transform the energy sector and the related industries,"" he says. ""I totally buy into it, and I wish for a higher carbon price.""As more companies make their environmental credentials central to how they present themselves to customers, employees and other stakeholders, lobbying efforts that clash with their climate-friendly branding carry greater reputational risks than before.Now that the private sector has positioned itself as an environmental leader, even some early advocates of companies leading the fight against climate change are now warning about the risk of half-measures.Explaining why a corporate social responsibility strategy that focuses on being less bad is not good enough, Paul Polman, the former Unilever chief executive, told an FT event last month: ""If you're a murderer and you killed 10 people, and now you're declaring that you're a better murderer by only killing five people, I don't think you'll get away with that.""Despite years of environmental promises from business, only a minority of people around the world trust business to do the right thing to address climate change, according to a recent poll by Edelman, the public relations agency.For Whitman at Climate Neutral, that scepticism reflects a mismatch between companies' rhetoric and the discouragingly limited impact most people have seen from their climate promises of recent years.""I think we have to evaluate it in terms of outcomes and not inputs, and right now the inputs are a lot of pledges and the outcomes are emissions [that] are continuing to rise,"" he says. ""You can't want climate change to be solved but only on your terms."" - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021",Copyright 2021 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|BANK OF AMERICA CORPASTRAZENECA PLC|NAICS551111 OFFICES OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIESNAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKINGSIC6712 OFFICES OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIESNAICS325412 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MANUFACTURINGSIC2834 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS|BAC (NYSE)BAC (LSE)8648 (TSE)AZN (STO)AZN (NYSE)AZN (LSE)|BRITISH ROYALTYNEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSCLIMATE CHANGECONFERENCES & CONVENTIONSEMISSIONSEXECUTIVESLOBBYINGGREEN FINANCEBRITISH MONARCHSENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRYGOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONCLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION & POLICYPUBLIC POLICYSEVERE WEATHERSUSTAINABILITYSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTENVIRONMENTALISMINTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONSTRADE DEVELOPMENTENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCESBUSINESS & PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONSCHAMBERS OF COMMERCEENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGYENVIRONMENTAL TREATIES & AGREEMENTSASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONSINSECTS & ARACHNIDSPOLITICSINTERNATIONAL TRADEUNITED NATIONS|BRITISH ROYALTYEMISSIONSGREEN FINANCEBRITISH MONARCHSENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRYSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTENERGY & UTILITIESPHARMACEUTICALS INDUSTRYALTERNATIVE & RENEWABLE ENERGYHOTELS & MOTELS|PRINCE CHARLES|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|UNITED KINGDOMAUSTRALIACANADAEUROPEMEXICONORTH AMERICA",BAC (NYSE)
168,Outrage over eco summit's CO2 emissions;EXPRESS REPORTER,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Paisley Daily Express,News,658,NEWS;Pg. 9,658,Scotland,,,GREENPEACE INTERNATIONAL,GREENPEACE INTERNATIONAL,Outrage over eco summit's CO2 emissionsEXPRESS REPORTER,"COP26 generated nearly triple the emissions of Paisley-based Glasgow Airport last year - and more than double the amount caused by COP25 due partly to the jet-set lifestyles of attendees.A report produced for the UK Government states that COP26 is on course to emit around 102,500 tonnes of CO2e - with around 61,500 tCO2e, or 60 per cent, solely from international flights.The 102,500 tCO2e figure means COP26's carbon footprint is nearly three times that of Glasgow Airport, which reported total emissions of 36,885 tCO2e last year.The average person in the UK is responsible for around seven tCO2e of emissions a year, and the venues on the SEC produce around 6,659 tonnes of CO2 a year - although two of the venues have the second lowest possible rating for energy efficiency.Boris Johnson, US president Joe Biden and Jeff Bezos have all sparked criticism for their luxury travel arrangements, despite their supposed commitment to the environment.Dr Doug Parr, chief scientist for Greenpeace UK, said international travel accounted for the majority of the carbon footprint.But he said it was ""not supposed to be a demonstration of sustainable lifestyles"", with 50 private jets landing on the first day and 118 business jets flying into Glasgow and Edinburgh airports, according to data compiled by aviation consultancy WingX.The total greenhouse gas emissions for COP25, which was held in Madrid in 2019, stood at 51,101 tCO2e, while at COP21 in Paris in 2015 the figure was 43,000 tCO2e.COP15 in Copenhagen produced around 26,000 tCO2e of emissions in 2009.Dr Parr said: ""The failure to reach any meaningful agreement about limiting aviation's vast carbon emissions - at a conference where 60 per cent of their emissions came from aviation, with a backing chorus of media outrage at the private jet hypocrisy of the elites - really highlights the lack of equity in these talks.""Creating loopholes for the use of the rich not only maintains their disproportionately high emissions, but makes it so much harder to persuade anyone else to cut.""At this COP, the final decision must commit to phase out fossil fuels, which means reducing demand for those fuels from high-carbon industries like aviation.""Policymakers and countries should ban short-haul flights wherever a viable alternative already exists, and invest in rail to create a transport system that's good for the planet while also being affordable and accessible to all.""Flight radar data also shows that some jets have been flying from Glasgow Airport to Prestwick Airport in order to park - a journey of less than 30 miles.Mr Johnson was condemned after returning to London from Glasgow last Tuesday via private jet to reportedly attend a function at a men-only private members' club.Downing Street said the journey was taken with consideration of ""time restraints"", but Anneliese Dodds, the Labour party chair, accused Mr Johnson of ""staggering hypocrisy"".When the Prime Minister returned to Glasgow on Wednesday, he did so by train.Monica Lennon, Scottish Labour's spokeswoman for net zero, energy, and transport, said: ""If COP26 is to deliver the bold change needed, then those involved should lead by example.""Travel emissions were always going to be inevitable, but this stark rise will no doubt raise some eyebrows.""We all have a responsibility to do our part and those setting the rules must be willing to play by them.""Warm words will ring hollow if they're not matched with action.""The UK Government has pledged COP26 will be carbon neutral, a promise it aims to uphold via the purchase of UNFCCC-recognised offsets such as certified emission reductions.A spokeswoman said: ""As official UNFCCC figures show, COP26 is a substantially bigger event than other recent COPs, with over 39,000 participants as against nearly 27,000 at COP25.""A definitive total of the event's carbon footprint is expected to be published in the coming months once the data has been received and analysed.",Copyright 2021 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|PDE|ENGLISH|GREENPEACE INTERNATIONAL|National Edition|GREENHOUSE GASESAEROSPACE & ENVIRONMENTCARBON OFFSETSEMISSIONSENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINTSOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE & LIFESTYLEAGREEMENTSPUBLIC POLICYBUSINESS TRAVELCONFERENCES & CONVENTIONSENVIRONMENTAL & WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONSSUSTAINABILITYENERGY EFFICIENCY & CONSERVATIONUS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020|AIRPORTSAEROSPACE & ENVIRONMENTCARBON OFFSETSEMISSIONSENERGY & UTILITIESBUSINESS TRAVELPASSENGER & CARGO AIRCRAFTINTERNATIONAL TOURISMAIRLINESENERGY EFFICIENCY & CONSERVATIONTRANSPORTATION & WAREHOUSING|BORIS JOHNSONJOE BIDENJEFFREY P BEZOS|GLASGOW, SCOTLANDLONDON, ENGLANDEDINBURGH, SCOTLAND|UNITED KINGDOMUNITED STATESSCOTLAND",
169,Sustainable food should be at the centre of climate action,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),News,1081,VOICES;Pg. 28,1081,England & Wales,BAN KI-MOON,,,,Sustainable food should be at the centre of climate action,"The 25,000 or so delegates gathered in Glasgow for Cop26 have a critical task - to discuss and agree on solutions to avert a climate catastrophe that could bring untold destruction to the world. As negotiations stretch into the nights and become heated, as they often do, the one thing they can count on is having climate-friendly and healthy meals.The organisers of Cop26 have ensured that 80 per cent of food served at the conference is seasonal and sourced in Scotland, such as Mara seaweed, which can grow without fertiliser, fresh water or soil, and carrots and potatoes stored using renewable energy. Many of my team members present at the conference have reported back on the good quality of food. There is also a concerted and commendable effort being made to reduce food waste.This is a perfect example of how food and farming are both a driver of and a solution to the climate crisis. Unless we change how we currently produce, process, transport, consume and discard food, we will not make any headway on climate change mitigation and adaptation, the defining issue of our time.Discussions on climate change currently tend to focus on transport and energy sectors, but food systems account for more than a third of global greenhouse emissions, with far-ranging environmental effects. Agriculture is also extremely vulnerable to shifts in temperature and rainfall. More and more farmers, particularly smallholders who produce about a third of the world's food, are struggling with lost harvests and livestock, while trying to adapt to increasingly irregular weather conditions.Heat, drought, floods, storms, sea level rises and insect infestation are just some of the climate risks food producers are facing. They have the potential to devastate the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people - the farmers as well as the people who rely on them for food.In 2020, 811 million people were undernourished and around 3 billion - more than one in three - could not afford healthy diets. To make things worse, rising concentrations of carbon dioxide are expected to reduce the availability of critical nutrients such as protein, iron and zinc.This is the delicate balance we must strive for - slashing emissions while ensuring enough nutritious food for everyone, leaving no one behind. We need to highlight the interconnected issues of food systems, hunger and poverty, biodiversity and stability, and climate adaptation and resilience. Agriculture must be a touchstone issue for powerful developing country blocks within the Cop26 negotiations.Agriculture is the main driver of deforestation and land conversion, but it also holds the keys to keep global warming below 2C. With the right investments in research and innovation, smallholder farmers, especially women, indigenous peoples and young people, can be part of the solution to many of the challenges we face, transforming food systems in ways that reduce hunger and poverty, improving access to healthy diets and protecting the environment and biodiversity. Nature-based adaptation solutions can provide us with healthy and delicious foods that are good for consumers, farmers and the planet.The UK has identified four key goals to achieve during the two-week Cop26 event, with an emphasis on protecting nature, including building resilient agricultural systems and halting deforestation as key adaptation and mitigation strategies.We saw the official launch of the Agriculture Innovation Mission for Climate initiative by the governments of the USA and UAE, calling for an increase in investment for climate-smart agriculture and food systems innovation over the next five years, which will accelerate the development of technologies and crops that can be adopted by even the poorest farmers.In addition, it was promising to see a coalition of funders pledge $575m (£429m) to CGIAR- the leading force in demand-driven agricultural research and innovation - to deliver climate-smart solutions to farmers in low-income countries.This is the most attention food systems and agriculture have ever received when compared to previous climate conferences, yet it would be premature of us to celebrate, because transforming food systems should be higher on the Cop26 agenda. For example, food systems are largely absent in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which are countries' blueprints for how to limit their greenhouse gas emissions, according to the Global Alliance for the Future of Food.The alliance is assessing NDCs of 14 key nations, including China, Egypt, South Africa and Kenya and has completed eight, including those of the UK, the US, Colombia and Bangladesh. What it found was worrying. No country has fully accounted for emissions associated with food imports, particularly those related to deforestation.Only Germany provided a clear commitment to move away from harmful subsidies and only two nations - Colombia and Kenya - have put forward ambitious measures to adopt ecologically friendly farming practices.Today, world leaders must focus equally on adaptation and mitigation. Investing wisely now to adapt to changes already underway and prepare for future climate shocks will prevent bigger losses and damages in years to come.If we really want to tackle the climate crisis, we must consider whole food systems. This means going beyond trees, land use and productivity and looking at the whole value chain as well as the people, from smallholder farmers and labourers, to food service workers and delivery drivers, who keep it running.The momentum around food system transformation and climate-resilient agriculture that has been created by the UN Food Systems Summit in September must be carried throughout Cop26, and then to the Nutrition for Growth Summit in Tokyo next month, another important pledging moment for world leaders.Six years ago, at the opening of the high-level session of the Paris climate conference, I said: ""The clock is ticking towards climate catastrophe."" The historic Paris Climate Agreement that emerged from the meeting laid the groundwork for a world where there is long-term peace, stability and prosperity, but there is much more work to be done.Positioning greener, fairer and more sustainable agricultural practices at the centre of climate action would go a long way towards achieving climate-resilient food systems that leave no one behind.Ban Ki-moon is the eigth UN secretary general and co-chair of the Ban Ki-moon Centre for Global Citizens",Copyright 2021 Independent Print Ltd All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|IA|ENGLISH|Voices|CLIMATE CHANGENEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSSUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURESUSTAINABLE PRODUCTSCLIMATOLOGYEMISSIONSHUNGER IN SOCIETYMALNUTRITIONNEGATIVE NEWSNUTRITIONAGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENTBIODIVERSITYCONSERVATIONENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCESENVIRONMENTALISMRENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRYWEATHERENVIRONMENTAL ACCIDENTS & DISASTERSDROUGHTPOLLUTION & ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTSENERGY & ENVIRONMENTCOOKING & ENTERTAININGDEFORESTATIONGLOBAL WARMINGGREENHOUSE GASESINDIGENOUS PEOPLESSEAWEED & ALGAEINSECTS & ARACHNIDSPOVERTY & HOMELESSNESSRESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT|ENERGY & UTILITIESSUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURESUSTAINABLE PRODUCTSEMISSIONSAGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENTALTERNATIVE & RENEWABLE ENERGYFOOD & BEVERAGERENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRYENERGY & ENVIRONMENTFARMERS & RANCHERSDEFORESTATIONLIVESTOCKGLOBAL WARMINGFERTILIZERS|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|SCOTLAND",
170,Towards an international high-level panel for climate resilient water investments in Africa,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Mail & Guardian,News,2080,,2080,"South Africa, Republic of",Special Reports,,,,Towards an international high-level panel for climate resilient water investments in Africa,"Africa was high on the agenda as world leaders met in Glasgow on 1 and 2 November for the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP26) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The World Leaders Summit, hosted by Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Boris Johnson, resulted in global and historic commitments concerning deforestation, reducing methane emissions and signing up for a clean technology breakthrough agenda, among others. For African leaders, led by Félix Tshisekedi, President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and current Chairperson of the African Union, the focus remained on securing climate finance for responding to climate change in Africa - specifically the $100-billion targeted annually for climate finance to underdeveloped countries, which has not yet been delivered. Tshisekedi noted that the global effort on climate change ""can't be won unless it is won in Africa"", which is home to 1.3-billion people. He was one of several African leaders, including Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan and Kenya's Uhuru Kenyatta, to highlight Africa's plight in the face of climate change. The 2021 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change States found that the rate of temperature increase in Africa is faster than the global average. Despite being most affected by climate change, the continent contributes only 4% to global emissions. Hassan told world leaders: ""Our pride, Mount Kilimanjaro, is drastically becoming bald due to glacier melting. Our exotic and beautiful archipelago, Zanzibar, is struggling with temperature rises, saltwater intrusion and inundation, thus impacting its tourism ecology. What does all this mean to a poor country like Tanzania? It means 30% of our Gross Domestic Product - that comes from agriculture, forestry and fisheries - is not sustainable.""In an event on the margins of the World Leaders Summit at COP26, former Tanzanian president Jakaya Kikwete called on the international community to support the establishment of an International High-Level Panel on Water Investments in Africa, which is urgently needed to accelerate investments in water security on the continent. Kikwete, speaking in his capacity as chair of Global Water Partnership  (GWP) Southern Africa and Africa Coordination, was addressing delegates from COP26's first ever Water Pavilion on 2 November during the event named Towards an International High Level Panel on Water Investments in Africa.  ""We urgently need the Panel because of our circumstances. One in three Africans face water insecurity, about 400-million Africans have no access to safe drinking water and about 700-million do not have access to good sanitation. The economic and service sectors do not get the water they need for optimal performance, thus impeding socioeconomic growth and development,"" said Kikwete. ""I am delighted to inform this assembly that GWP has joined hands with the African Ministers' Council on Water (AMCOW), African Union Development Agency (AUDA-NEPAD), African Development Bank (AfDB), UNICEF, UNDP and Global Centre for Adaptation (GCA) to convene the Panel. Work of appointing persons to be members of the Panel is ongoing by the convenors. We in Africa can't wait to see the Panel established and start working,"" said Kikwete. Ambassador Henk WJ Ovink, special envoy for International Water Affairs, Kingdom of The Netherlands, who moderated the side event stated that the Panel, which will be assembled from Heads of State in Africa and abroad over the course of 2022-2023, plans to develop a high-level action-forcing report and investment plan for the 2023 UN Conference and African Union Heads of States with a clear pathway and recommendations for countries to mobilise $30-billion per year towards bridging the water investment gap in Africa.""The AfDB estimates that US$64-billion will be needed to be invested annually to meet the 2025 Africa Water Vision for Water Security for all,"" said Kikwete. ""Currently, the figure stands between $10-billion and $19-billion, thus leaving a huge investment gap to be filled.""Kikwete added that Africa's water insecurity is only worsened by climate change.  ""As a result there is increased frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation in some parts of Africa and recurrent periods of drought in many parts of our dear continent. ""At the centre of this crisis is the African farmer. With over 95% of African food production being rain-fed, Africa's poor subsistence farmers are among the most hurt by climate change.""The High-Level Panel on Water Investments for Africa is supporting the goal of the Continental Africa Water Investment Programme (AIP), which originated in the 2018 report recommendations by the United Nations and World Bank-convened High Level Panel on Water. In 2019 AMCOW recommended that the Continental Africa Water Investment Programme (AIP) be conceived. Subsequently, the AMCOW Secretariat teamed up with African Union Development Agency - NEPAD, African Development Bank, Global Water Partnership in Africa and others to undertake the work of conceiving and developing the AIP. ""The AIP is one of the biggest successes of the UN-World Bank High Level Panel on Water,"" said Nchedi Moripe, chief director, global co-operation and strategic partnerships in the South African department of water and sanitation and sherpa to the UN-World Bank High Level Panel on Water. ""Therefore we call on African leaders to ensure that the African Union is pulling both the AIP and the proposed International High-Level Panel on Water Investments in Africa from the front. Water ministers also have a role to ensure that their leaders remain engaged throughout."" Moripe was speaking at the same event during COP26. The AIP was adopted by the Assembly of the African Union Heads of State and Government as part of Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa - Priority Action Plan 2 (PIDA-PAP 2) during the 34th ordinary session of African Union summit on 7 February 2021. The purpose of PIDA is to accelerate infrastructure development in Africa by strengthening large cross-border infrastructure projects that integrate energy, transportation, and water development on a continental scale.""The AIP was selected as part of PIDA-PAP 2 because we saw its potential to contribute to transboundary and regional investments in water - especially emphasising a nexus approach that finds linkages between health, energy, water and food security,"" said Dr Towela Nyirenda-Jere, Head: Economic Integration Division at AUDA-NEPAD. ""We are honoured to be part of the convenors of the panel that will move Africa's water agenda forward,"" added Nyirenda-Jere.  The AIP aims to leverage financing from development agencies, green climate funding, national budgets, and the private sector. The latter is a historically low source of funding for the African water sector, with only about $3-billion invested in sub-Saharan African water projects compared to $41.7-billion in East Asia and the Pacific and $36-billion in Latin America and the Caribbean since 1990. Reversing this trend will be a key challenge for the AIP.  Dr Ania Grobicki, deputy director for external affairs at the Green Climate Fund (GCF), said that leveraging private investment funds would be very important for water investments in Africa. The GCF is the largest global fund dedicated to help fighting climate change, and was established within the framework of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) to assist developing countries to respond to climate change. In terms of de-risking the African water sector and making it more attractive to investors including those from the private sector, the AIP plans to work with partners such as the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to establish a water investment facility with an element of technical support offered to African regulators and water utilities. ""We need to raise the standards and capacities of African utilities so that they are able to attract financing on their own merit,"" said Dr Pradeep Kurukulasuriya, executive coordinator and director, UNDP.  Osward Chanda, acting director of water and sanitation at the AfDB, said that as part of the drive to increase private sector interest in Africa, water should be an reflection of how Africa's governments themselves use their national budget allocations and resources as a means to leverage external finance flows. The AfDB group has recently approved a new water policy, prioritising water security and the transformation of water assets to foster sustainable, green and inclusive economic growth in regional member countries. This is expected to support the implementation of the AIP and its goal to transform the outlook for water investments in Africa.   ""The AIP represents new hope for Africa because it brings together governments, investment banks, development agencies and the private sector and pulls them in the same direction,"" said Dario Soto-Abril, chief executive of GWP.  ""This is an Africa-bound and created initiative and a beacon for countries in the global north to invest in the commitment they have made in the Paris Agreement and all UNFCC conferences,"" he added. In its support to the AIP, the International High-Level Panel on Water Investments will drive global political mobilisation and international engagement to narrow the water investment gap on the continent and meet the socioeconomic needs for water.""The panel will bring high level visibility and unlock increased political commitment and resources. And it builds on initiatives that we already have in place, such as the AIP Water Investment Scorecard,"" said Kelly Ann Naylor, director of water, sanitation and hygiene at UNICEF. UNICEF is one of the partners supporting the development the AIP Water Investment Scorecard, under the leadership of AMCOW and AUDA-NEPAD, which will inform the work of the Panel by supporting African countries to track progress on the mobilisation of investments in the water sector and raise awareness among heads of state and government decision-makers on bottlenecks.  Development of the AIP Water Investments Scorecard kicked off in April 2021, during a high-level event co-hosted by Dr Ibrahim Mayaki, the chief executive of AUDA-NEPAD, and Kikwete. It's anticipated that the AIP scorecard will then be presented to the African Union heads of state in February 2022.Also in the first quarter of 2022 is the anticipated launch of the International High-Level Panel on Water Investments. Most recently, in September 2021, the executive committee of AMCOW formally welcomed the nomination of Dr Hage Gottfried Geingob, President of Namibia, and the current host country of the Presidency of AMCOW as panel co-chair. Kikwete has been nominated as the alternate co-chair, while the Kingdom of the Netherlands, host government of the GCA and co-host of the 2023 UN Conference on the Water Action Decade, will be approached to co-chair as a representative of the Global North.""A roadmap for the Panel has already been adopted by the convening organisations,"" said Alex Simalabwi, executive secretary: GWPSA-ACU and head: joint secretariat for the panel. ""Key events for the panel will include the World Water Forum 2022 in Senegal, the African Bank annual meetings, World Water Week, and COP27 planned to take place in Egypt in the final quarter of 2022,"" said Simalabwi.  ""An inaugural meeting was hosted by the GCA, on the side-lines of the High-Level Dialogue on Climate Adaptation with Global Leaders ahead of COP26, in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, on 7 September 2021,"" he added. The High-Level Dialogue was co-convened by Ban Ki-Moon, 8th secretary-general of the United Nations and co-chair of the GCA; Professor Patrick Verkooijen, chief executive of the GCA; and Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund.During the GCA High-Level Dialogue, Kikwete urged world leaders to place water at the centre of adaptation action - specifically for Africa.  He reiterated that message at COP26 this week. ""It is of utmost critical urgency that increased attention is paid to adaptation interventions and investments related to water retention, storage, rainwater harvesting, water source protection, and water infrastructure,"" said Kikwete. The post Towards an international high-level panel for climate resilient water investments in Africa appeared first on The Mail & Guardian.",Copyright 2021 M and G Media (Pty) Ltd.

171,TREATY IN BALANCE OVER COAL;Time running out as hope of key deal on fossil fuels fades,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Scottish Daily Mail,News,734,"NEWS;Pg. 18,19",734,"Scotland
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland",Colin Fernandez ; Claire Ellicott,,,,TREATY IN BALANCE OVER COALTime running out as hope of key deal on fossil fuels fades,"THE fate of a landmark global agreement on climate change appeared to be hanging in the balance last night as major coal-producing countries demanded it be watered down.Saudi Arabia, Russia and India insisted on removing references to 'phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies' from the deal delegates were hoping to unveil today.It had been hoped that including such an unprecedented commitment would send a powerful message to fossil fuel-producing countries to find alternative sources of energy.Global subsidies to fossil fuels are worth around £300billion a year. It would have been the first time that a reference to phasing out coal power had ever appeared in a Cop treaty.But last night, it appeared the commitment would be deleted from the final text of the deal following opposition from the three countries.UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned that limiting global warming to 1.5C - the key aim of the climate talks in Glasgow - was now 'on life support' but added 'until the last moment, hope should be maintained'.The Cop26 summit had been due to finish today, but last night delegates warned that deep rifts among the negotiating parties meant the talks were likely to overrun way beyond their allotted time.Sources told the Mail that security guards had been booked to work on Sunday, indicating the conference will run into the weekend.It came as protesters dressed as shrouded bodies gathered outside Cop26 to represent the grave effects of climate change.Extinction Rebellion activists were seen lying outside the venue for the crucial talks under a banner reading 'climate crisis' - the same day that people gathered at ceremonies around the country for Armistice Day.Several of the demonstrators held up placards saying 'Remember Climate Death'.As well as the issue of subsidies for fossil fuels, another major sticking point at the talks is concern among developing countries that there is not enough available finance to help compensate them for costs associated with adapting their economies to cut carbon emissions.But Cop26 president Alok Sharma tried to play down claims that the Glasgow talks would be a flop.He said: 'Time is running out and, as I speak, my ministerial co-facilitators, other ministers and negotiators are rolling up their sleeves and working hard to find solutions to some of the most intractable issues - solutions which so far have eluded us for six years.'He said that discussions on providing finance to compensate developing countries needed to progress.'We still have a monumental challenge ahead of us, but collectively we have no choice but to rise to that challenge and strain every sinew to achieve a timely outcome that we can all be proud of - because ultimately, this outcome, whatever it is, will belong to all of us,' Mr Sharma said. But he played down a suggestion that because cuts to emissions will not keep global warming down to 1.5C - the goal of the 2015 Paris Agreement - Cop26 had failed.Mr Sharma said that there was still the rest of the decade to get emissions down to 1.5C.Current pledges made by the 197 countries attending the conference would only limit temperature rises to 2.4C, which experts warn will result in catastrophic heatwaves, extreme weather, rising sea levels and widespread flooding.Mr Sharma said: 'Whilst a window of keeping 1.5C within reach is closing, it is still possible to get there, which is why I and others have talked about ""the decisive decade"".'But the Cop26 president denied that he was attempting to 'stage a moment of drama' to get the agreement finalised. He said: 'I think people have sometimes described me as ""no drama Sharma"". I don't think we can overemphasise how difficult this is.'If it were easy we would have resolved this over the past six years, but we haven't.'We have to ensure we are using every moment between now and the end of this Cop to reach an agreement.'In another protest in Glasgow yesterday, around 1,000 people marched to the Home Office in the city's Ibrox area to protest against the UK Government's treatment of migrants.The demonstration, which was led by Migrants Organising for Rights and Empowerment, No Evictions Network and the Unity Centre, set off from Kenmure Street, Pollokshields, at about 10am.The protesters then marched to the Home Office on Brand Street, near the Cop26 Green Zone, arriving at around 1.30pm.'Working hard to find solutions'",Copyright 2021 Associated Newpapers Ltd.

173,Waving the green flag,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Nepali Times,News,3099,,3099,"Nepal, Federal Democratic Republic of",,,,,Waving the green flag,"Kathmandu, Nov. 12 -- The climate summit inGlasgowis coming to an end today. For the past two weeks, leaders and activists from around the world have gathered to decide on the course of action against a hotter planet.From the mountains to the oceans and the poles to the torrid, climate crisis is affectingevery corner of the world. People around the world as in Nepal are experiencing flash floods, prolonged droughts, scorching heat waves andunprecedented wildfire.And scientists say this will only get worse with the global temperatures set to surpass well above 1.5deg Celsius above pre-industrial levels, at the current rate of warming.Real climate action makes a difference and Nepali Times spoke to three young Nepali activists to know more about their initiatives.Yajaswi RaiFounder ofLeklekk: The Green Wave, Yajaswi believes in recognising and working on intersectional and cross cutting issues. Her primary interest lies in environment sustainability, and indigenous as well as other vulnerable communities. She is also one of the Youth Gender Activists at UN Women, and a central committee member at Youth Congress Nepal.Nepali Times: Can you tell us a little about Leklekk?Leklekk: The Green Wave works on a circular economy of various environment conscious products and services. Leklekk means 'Green' in my mother tongue.The company works with organisations to educate the consumers, sell and recycle eco-friendly products. We also plant equal if not more trees to replenish the resources consumed. The company is striving to achieve a fair balance of profitability, social responsibility and environmental sustainability through three phases: 'Give', 'Recycle' and 'Grow', working in various districts of Nepal.Leklekk at the moment has paper and PLA products for restaurants. We have bamboo toothbrushes, and produce bamboo medals and other for schools. We resell our recycled papers and crafts in bulk as well.What motivated you to start the initiative?Starting Leklekk was an amalgamation of need and interest at the same time. I am a believer of a holistic and sustainable development hence working in the field of indigenous knowledge and environment was always an interest. On the other hand, my pet almost died due to plastic congestion, and it's not a unique story for animals, and will soon be applicable in human lives too, hence a need.Can you elaborate a little on the projects you have with the schools and restaurants?In schools we work on educating the students regarding sustainable practices. During lockdown, along with educating them, we held a nationwide ""Green Mindset Competition"" where students all over the country from age 6-25 years sent us their practices or creative outputs of environmental consciousness.In restaurants, we first educate them, tell them why plastic is harmful and ways we can make the restaurants more environmentally conscious. Alongside, we supply eco-friendly products to them, but also recollect their paper wastes for recycling in their next orders.Do you think the climate crisis impacts women and marginalised communities disproportionately? How so?Yes, but this is however more visible in places with gender inequality. The majority of people affected by climate change are women and marginalised communities and the reasons are multifaceted. For example, most often we see men swimming in ponds, rivers and pools. So in times of water disasters like tsunami, floods, it is no surprise more women die more due to drowning.Economically, it is comparatively difficult for marginalised populations and women to achieve or own places, knowledge or equipment, which are safer. Because their mobility is also more restricted, they tend to still be in regions vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.Physically too, water shortage due to the climate change has added to the drudgery of women, they have to walk longer to access water for irrigation and household purposes. In an aftermath of climate disasters, women are more vulnerable to sexual harassment at rescue centres.How can we include and prioritisewomen in real climate actionat home and not just highlight their vulnerability at global platforms like COP26?Educating everyone about the issues of climate change and the vulnerability is the first step. Actions have to begin from households and to national and international levels. In developing country like Nepal, safety training in disaster preparedness and safety is crucial.Every local government should have demographics of vulnerable people like pregnantwomen, children, old people, in their areas, and map the vulnerability of their community itself. Each unit then should be prepared with proper human, financial, and contingent resources for any climate related disasters.The grit and knowledge of marginalised and indigenous communities have to be respected and brought into practice, it is one of the most sustainable ways to act against climate change. Our leaders should also start listening to experts and prioritise these issues.Nepal should also start carrying out independent research and actions to identify the needs for the future. Climate related financing should be a priority in our budget.Best examples of climate initiatives in Nepal?Every small to big climate action is the best climate initiative. My niece rejecting one more plastic in a grocery shop, a friend choosing to become vegan, my customers choosing to switch to bamboo toothbrush, friends protesting, to all various movements and enterprises like Global Youth Biodiversity Network, Leklekk: The Green Wave, Fashion Revolution, Harin Nepal, and countless others are all the best examples.Samikshya RaiSamikshya Rai is a full-time teacher and a part-time sustainable blogger from Nepalganj. A graduate Environment Science, she shares her everyday practice on her Instagram page@thesustainable.lifeWhat does sustainable living mean for you?Well scientifically,sustainableliving is a way of reducing your carbon footprint on earth. For me personally, it's a lifestyle which I have control over.I wake up every day and get to decide how much natural resource I am going to use that day, or the amount of money I spend on the things I actually need. I get to make a decision to help a local business by buying their goods. And these actions collectively have a positive impact on the environment and our future generation. I feel that living sustainably makes you considerate and kind towards nature as well as other human beings.What got you interested in it?After the2015 earthquake, I was volunteering in an organisation in Kathmandu, where I was a part of an environmental campaign called ""No thanks I carry my own bag"". The more I learned about climate change, the more interested I became. It was then that I decided I want to study Environmental Science and do my bit in protecting the planet.I started watching vlogs and reading blogs from people who had been practicing a sustainable lifestyle. Most of them were from West. But with time I came to a realisation that we Nepalis have been practicing sustainability for a long time. For example, we use duna and tapari, made from leaves for puja and other functions. Our Nepali moms are true ""Sustainable Heroes"". They use old glass jars to store pickle or store vegetables in an ice-cream tub in a refrigerator. When a t-shirt gets old, they don't throw it away, it is used as a pochha to clean the floors.My parents grow their own food and they have so much respect for nature. They live a sustainable lifestyle themselves, which has influenced me to lead one as well.How can people take the first steps to a more sustainable lifestyle?Living a sustainable life is easy if you make it so. For beginners I would suggest starting by doing small actions in your daily life. You can start using reusable bottles and containers instead of plastic. When you go shopping make a list of things you need beforehand instead of buying random goods just because it's on a sale or looks attractive on the shelves. Extremeconsumerismis a major factor contributing to the global climate crisis.Women can switch to reusable products like menstrual cup, reusable razors. For sustainable fashion you can opt for thrift stores or borrow/rent clothes. Also, do your research if your clothes are made ethically or not. You can learn to grow vegetables on your own. Choosing an electric vehicle is also an option but let's hope the tax for EV is further reduced. Using public vehicle is also a sustainable practice.Before starting a sustainable lifestyle, we should be mentally prepared because 'eco anxiety' is a thing. Once you start learning about climate crisis and how serious it is, it can be overwhelming for some.Does sustainable have to be expensive?Sustainable living is not a matter of privilege, it's a matter of necessity, and it is a matter of urgency for a better cause. Sustainable living shouldn't be expensive but unfortunately it is, the main reason being lack of demand and high manufacturing cost.I tried to buy ahempyoga mat once in Kathmandu but I couldn't afford it. Sustainable clothes can be expensive as well because they are made with eco-friendly materials. But in the long run eco-friendly products are cheaper. For example, a menstrual cup costs Rs500-2500, but it can be used for years.More importantly, sustainable living doesn't only mean fancy/trendy sustainable products. There are other budget friendly ways to live a sustainable life and save nature. Just practice what's feasible for you.What role do young people like yourself play in mitigating the impacts of climate crisis?Young people will bear the impacts of climate change. So, it is our responsibility to protect this earth and as such youth all over the world are stepping forward in solidarity to fight back. Our generation should utilise the skills, knowledge, and turn to science, technology and education in any way possible to speak up for ourselves.Young people should advocate with their governments as well as world leaders on this issue. There are also different career paths that can be taken to save the environment. One can volunteer in a climate organisation, or even be a part of climate research.How can government proactively help the youth to tackle climate change?The most important thing that our government can do is make young people part of environmental policymaking and development. Youth activists should be given an opportunity to be part of programs like COP, more so that the officials filling out government quota who go there and click pictures at best. For a better systematic change there should be inclusiveness.Education plays a big role in mitigating the climate crisis. It is high time that government redesign the curriculum and include content such as best practices to saving energy, ways to reduce carbon footprint, recycling, growing their own vegetables, among others. They should be educated and made a party of climate policy.The government should invest on youth-led climate projects and businesses. Climate smart agriculture should be promoted. More green jobs should be created. The government should understand the urgency of the situation and that only our generation can save this planet.How can we keep up the focus on climate crisis post conferences like COP26?It's the responsibility of individuals and government/private organisations who attended COP26 to share and implement their findings from the program at national level. Better climate action plans should be executed at local level.Local community should be made a part of implementation. They should be made well aware of global climate crisis. Young people should raise their voice to push their governments to actually work on climate targets set. Those in power should be held accountable, climate issues should be prioritised all year around.Best examples of climate initiatives in NepalLAPA, Local Adaptation plan of action is one of the best climate initiatives in policy level in Nepal. It aims to identify vulnerable local communities and work closely with them to mitigate climate crisis. It is supported by National Adaptation Programme of action.Baghmara, a buffer zone community forest in Chitwan which covers 215.6 ha. is managed by local people. It is contiguous with Chitwan National Park. It showcases that conservation is effective only when local community is made a part of it and benefited from it.There are some Local Business promoting Environment friendly products like Ecosathi Nepal, Deego Nepal, Bora Studio Nepal etc. These businesses work closely with local community to manufacture their products. Khaalisisi is an NGO working with waste workers which aims to build Nepal as one of the top 20 Recycling Nation by 2030.Shail ShresthaShail Shrestha is a program director atDigo Bikas Institute. He has been involved inbicycle activismsince 2009, and has gradually expanded his work and activism towards broader urban agenda and sustainability aspect of development itself.You have advocated for the use of bicycles and a cycle friendly city for over a decade now, what changes have you seen?Especially post federalism, local governments have taken lead and shown interest to bring innovative solution that serve the public. This has made it possible for cycle lanes to be built in some municipalities as Lalitpur and Chitwan.LMC in particular has taken lead to make its streetscycle friendly. They have also started branding itself as the first cycle friendly municipality of Nepal. That has built pressure and motivation on other municipalities including Kathmandu. The lessons of LMC will help and assist in development of cycle lanes elsewhere as well. They have also started second phase of cycle lane construction and are now lobbying to make the ring road cycle-friendly. Lalitpur has also formed cycle act to ensure legal backing to support, secure and promote use of cycle as a form of commute.Are people and the government more aware receptive about it?Yes. Back in 2009, promotion of bicycle was taken as anti-development by some traffic police officers when we reached out to them. Now that the urban centres are branding themselves as cycle friendly due to increased awareness around climate change, governments have as least understood the value of cycling, and now see cycle not as a tech of the past but as a solution of the future. The frequency of cycle events and participation in them, and the youth who cycle to commute is a proof that even the public understand its significance now.Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba during his address at COP26 announced Nepal's ambition to reach net zero emission by 2045. Given Nepal's negligible carbon footprint, and abundance clean energy sources, shouldn't we be able to reach net zero emission way before 2045?We need to be careful about ""net zero"". Net zero is based off marketing possibilities and trading of carbon mitigation efforts. Through it, bigger countries like USA can buy carbon credit from countries like Nepal for the forest conservation or afforestation the latter does. That way the former can continue polluting and making profit from fossil companies and still act like they are doing enough.Nepal should have taken stand against 'net zero' and demanded 'real zero'. But under the pressure of the powerful countries and fossil lobbyist, we did not. That is my stand on net zero.The commitment of net zero earlier than 2045 could deviate Nepal from focusing on the protection of the communities in the forefront of climate crisis. Nepal will need to equally focus on loss and damage, and adaptation fronts as communities are already facing the impacts of climate change through erratic rains and drier seasons. Reaching net zero could be achieved early, but should not be at the cost of lives of people.Oftentimes Nepal's stance at COPs is to ask developed countries money to adapt with climate change for their historical emissions. But shouldn't Nepal also work on mitigation measures at home? And what are some of those?Nepal should definitely work on mitigation and it has indeed committed to it through its Nationally Determined Contributions. Nepal has received huge climate funds to for the electrification and improvement of cooking systems and also for the conservation of Chure. There are mitigation as well as adaptation approaches.How can we keep up the focus on climate crisis post COP26?Now that we are experiencing extreme weather events around the world including in Nepal, not losing focus from climate change should not be difficult. What we do about it is another issue. Focusing on the vulnerable communities that are facing the impacts of annual disruptive weather for years should be of priority for Nepal.Since Nepal doesn't have a dedicated ministry that works throughout the year on the issue, civil society and media should support the government agencies for institutional assistance. There also need to improve the institutional memory of Nepal across multiple COPs. What hasn't helped is the constant change of the government and ministers which has left us without a dedicated climate expert within the government.What are some of the best examples of climate initiatives in Nepal?As part of the Car free cities alliance, I want to share that the historic medieval cities of the Kathmandu valley that were built long before vehicles can provide viable solution to not just carbon mitigation but also for climate resilience.Some municipalities this year supported the farmers that were hard hit by erratic rain. This is a good example of building climate resilience. Nepal government has also contributed in alternative energy development.The massive use of electric rickshaw across southern plains could have been a great mitigation example, but Nepal failed to recognise as a mitigation measure.What steps can people take on a personal level to minimise their own carbon footprint?This is a crisis at the scale of civilisation, so changing the bulb or just cycling to work alone will not be enough. Thinking/understanding at what phase of global science and politics we have reached at is very important. People need to demand change for the leaders to act. This mobilisation is needed at local, national and international level.Nepal needs to get its climate act togetherNepal's greenwashing in Glasgow, Rasmi BaskotaCOPOUT at COP26, Sonia AwalePublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Nepali Times.

174,Australia in push to water down summit declaration,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Sydney Morning Herald (Australia),News,756,NEWS;Pg. 13,756,Australia,Bevan Shields and Nick O'Malley,,,,Australia in push to water down summit declaration,"Glasgow: Australia and other countries are working to water down a key proposal from the Glasgow climate summit which would pressure the Morrison government to overturn its opposition to a more ambitious 2030 emissions reductions target.The behind-the-scenes negotiations during the dying days of COP26 took place as its host, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, condemned world leaders for ""sitting on their hands"" and conceded the core goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5 degrees was now at grave risk.""It's clear that after a surge of really positive, game-changing announcements last week ... negotiations are getting tough,"" he said.Johnson declined repeated opportunities to name which countries were blocking progress.""I think everybody knows who needs to do what. Everybody understands the intricate balance of the negotiations,"" he said.""The world knows what a mess our planet is in. The world has heard leaders from every country, every continent, stand here and acknowledge the need for action. And the world will find it absolutely incomprehensible if we fail to deliver that.""The joint declaration by China and the US yesterday stating that the two superpowers will put aside their geopolitical rivalries to tackle climate change has raised hopes the roadblock to a strong 2030 commitment has been removed.Addressing a press conference at the COP26 summit, Chinese climate envoy Xie Zhenhua unveiled a joint-declaration designed to ""enhance climate action in the 2020s"" and said the two nations were determined to tackle global warming.While Australia has committed to reducing emissions to net zero by 2050, the Morrison government declined to lift its 2030 target of reducing emissions by 26 to 28 per cent due to strong opposition from Coalition MPs. Morrison has forecast a 35 per cent cut to emissions by 2030 in a formal document lodged in Glasgow, however the projection does not have the same force as a binding target.The terms of a draft Glasgow accord released this week would give nations that have not submitted ""new or updated"" 2030 targets another 12 months to ""revisit and strengthen"" their emissions reduction effort. The Australian government and other countries are working to have that element altered or removed. Australia is also unhappy with another proposal which ""calls upon"" nations to speed up the phase-out of coal and fossil fuel subsidies.There is a strong expectation that the final language will be softened or removed by the time a deal is completed today.Asked whether watering down the draft text would imperil the goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5 degrees, Johnson replied: ""The risk of sliding back I think would be an absolute disaster for the planet. As we go into the final furlong, that's where the horses change places. That's the most difficult moment.""Energy Minister Angus Taylor said Australia was an ""active and constructive participant in the negotiations to ensure a positive outcome for COP26"".One Australian government official noted the COP26 agreements are usually formed on a consensus basis, suggesting opposition to the draft text will likely lead to it being changed. Simonetta Sommaruga, a Swiss politician in charge of settling the issue, conceded views ""still differ widely"".In one sign of the extent of the disagreement, Sommaruga revealed some countries had even asked for the time between updated targets to be expanded to 10 years instead of the existing five.Elsewhere, Glasgow negotiators are having difficulty striking agreement on financing, adaption and compensation for loss and damage. There is also unease over a proposal for the United Nations to convene another summit of world leaders in 2023.Warning of a tense final two days of negotiations, COP26 President Alok Sharma said some countries would have to reverse their positions to reach consensus.""My big, big ask is to come armed with the currency of compromise,"" he said.""What we agree in Glasgow will set the future for our children and grandchildren. I know we will not want to fail them.""He also stuck to the goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5 degrees, reminding negotiators of a recent speech by Mia Mottley, the Barbados Prime Minister, who said 2 degrees of warming would be a ""death sentence"" for her country.Johnson condemned countries which had ""spent six years conspicuously patting themselves on the back"" for signing the Paris Agreement only to ""edge toward default now that vulnerable nations and future generations are demanding payment, here now, in Glasgow"".",Copyright 2021 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|EMISSIONSPRESS CONFERENCESCLIMATE CHANGEHEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENTPRIME MINISTERSAIR QUALITY REGULATIONGLOBAL WARMINGENERGY DEPARTMENTSGOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERSBRITISH PRIME MINISTERS|EMISSIONSENERGY & UTILITIESGLOBAL WARMINGENERGY DEPARTMENTS|BORIS JOHNSON|GLASGOW, SCOTLANDSYDNEY, AUSTRALIA|EARTH|AUSTRALIACHINAUNITED KINGDOM",
175,Covering a Global Climate Summit,"November 12, 2021 Friday",New York,The New York Times,News,1079,Section A;Column 0;Foreign Desk;Pg. 2;TIMES INSIDER,1079,,By Megan DiTrolio,,,,Covering a Global Climate Summit,"Two Times journalists on the ground in Glasgow -- one who is at her first climate conference, and another who is covering her 10th -- share what it's like on the inside of the event.Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.   The United Nations climate change conference known as COP26 officially comes to an end on Friday, as nearly 200 nations try to finalize an agreement to tackle global warming. World leaders, climate experts and activists gathered in Glasgow to galvanize countries into preventing the average global temperature from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. COP26 is the 10th climate conference Lisa Friedman, a reporter on our Climate desk, has covered. It is the first for Lyndsey Layton, the desk's deputy editor.  In separate interviews, they discussed lost luggage, The Times's approach to coverage, and why, despite some criticism, summits such as COP26 are important for making change. Their answers have been edited and condensed.  When did you arrive at the conference?LISA FRIEDMAN I arrived on Saturday, Oct. 30. My luggage arrived the next night -- my flight was delayed, and while we all made our connecting flight to Glasgow, none of our luggage did. I leave on Nov. 14, the Sunday after the conference is supposed to officially close. After 10 times covering this, I know that it sometimes goes into many, many hours of overtime, so I wanted to give myself a little breathing room to do stories and tell readers what it all came to and meant.  Is the conference different from what you were expecting?LYNDSEY LAYTON I didn't really quite know what to expect. This may sound obvious, but it's one thing to have edited so many stories about the global nature of climate change. It's another to come to a place like this and hear all these languages. People have come from all over the planet, concerned about this problem and are working on it and trying to find a way forward.What is different about COP26 compared with conferences that you've covered in the past?FRIEDMAN The most important one to compare this to is in 2015, when countries signed the Paris Agreement. There, you had the head of the United Nations climate body and lawmakers marching with activists down the streets of Paris and New York ahead of the conference, promising to work together to form an agreement. Since then, we have seen countries not really live up to what they promised. There's a lot more anger and frustration from developing countries and from environmental activists that the moment is not being met. I'd say that there's a lot more pressure on countries to not just make promises, but to show that they're really acting.  What's the energy like at the conference?LAYTON I've had some really interesting conversations. To give you a sense of the variety of issues: I spoke with a Scottish member of Parliament who comes from an old coal mining town, and the coal mine is shut down. His people are struggling. I asked, ''What do they think of climate change?'' And he said, ''They don't care.'' He said, ''Climate change is a middle-class issue. My people are worried about food on the table, a roof over their heads and a way to make a living.'' That dilemma is something that is in West Virginia, too. If this country transitions to green energy, there will be displacement. There will be people and communities that are going to suffer. The question is, how do you prop those up? How do you bring in new employment, new activity? It's so interesting to be able to meet people here who are experiencing the challenges and the impacts of climate change in different ways.   What kinds of precautions did you take against Covid-19?FRIEDMAN Our team had a number of calls on safety protocol before we came. We all came armed with masks and hand sanitizer. Once here, the protocol is supposed to be that you take a rapid test and you register your results with the National Health Service and you can only get in once you show negative results. That adds a logistical layer getting in. Inside, everything is pretty distant and spaced and people are wearing masks in the hallway, but it's also a conference of more than 30,000 people doing work, so masks come off and there are scrums.  There are still risks. There have been reports of people testing positive. Both the United Nations climate body and the British presidency of the conference had been really not transparent at all about cases. As journalists, we all find it really troubling, the lack of transparency about the numbers. That's been an issue here.  How does the collective focus on shared goals make you feel?LAYTON There are so many issues; it's such a complex problem. And every nation that comes has its own set of particular issues and concerns and its own internal politics. Like the United States -- we're very divided over climate policy, as are so many other nations. There's so much to discuss and these little conversations are happening between negotiators in rooms that we can't access. You don't really have eyes into the real meat of the discussions; you're just trying to follow the bouncing ball and trying to pick up intel here and there. It's very hard to get the overall view of what's really happening. That's the challenge that our reporters have.  How do you create coverage that really stands out?LAYTON We started planning for this way in advance, months and months and months ago, to figure out what would be the emerging themes. We started thinking about this a long time ago and Hannah Fairfield, the Climate editor, has been super organized. We had a game plan coming into COP26. We had a number of stories that we published before we even got to Scotland. Then we had a plan going in for stories we wanted to do here in addition to whatever news we could break.  There's a question circulating online on whether the summit is effective. Is that refrain hitting the summit?FRIEDMAN I have seen some of that. But, no summit, no conference, can solve everything. These conferences are forcing moments. Countries and leaders are put on the spot and they have to commit to things. And then they are on the record committing to these things and we can see whether they make good on their pledges or not. As problematic as some of the charges are, without these big summits, without the eyes of the world on leaders, you wouldn't get new commitments.",Copyright 2021 The New York Times Company,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|CLIMATE CHANGECONFERENCES & CONVENTIONSGLOBAL WARMINGJOURNALISMCLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION & POLICYWRITERSUNITED NATIONSAGREEMENTSENVIRONMENTALISMEARTH & ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCEENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCESDEVELOPING COUNTRIES|GLOBAL WARMINGWRITERSBAGGAGE HANDLING|GLASGOW, SCOTLANDPARIS, FRANCE",

China, People's Republic of",Harvey Morris,,,,Greenwashing versus true commitment,"Activists take part in a march against global climate change, in Nairobi, capital of Kenya, Oct 29, 2021. (PHOTO / XINHUA)Negotiators who have gathered at the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP26, to find ways to ensure that the world meets its climate targets have been invited to put their faith in banks and global investors to save the planet.In an initiative that has been greeted with skepticism from climate campaigners, a coalition of banks, insurance companies and investment firms committed$100 trillion of private capital to help the world meet net-zero carbon emissions targets by 2050.The idea is that these big spenders — they include some of the biggest international banks — will direct their clients' money toward planet-saving investments and shun the fossil fuels that are contributing to global warming.So far, 450 financial institutions, spread across 45 countries, have signed up to the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a coalition convened by the UN in April under the leadership of Mark Carney, the UN's special envoy on climate action and finance.Carney, the Canadian former head of the United Kingdom's central bank, said, ""We now have the essential plumbing in place to move climate change from the fringes to the forefront of finance so that every financial decision takes climate change into account.""The theory behind the idea is that governments alone do not have the resources to fund the energy transition and that private money is vital to ensuring its success.However, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero has been the target of criticism from climate campaigners because it allows the loophole of continuing to finance fossil fuel extraction during the transition.Carney believes big investors will have an interest in funding a clean energy transformation because that is where future profits lie. He said there is no reason investors backing low-carbon projects should have to make do with lower returns.Despite this lure of future profits, big banks were reported ahead of COP26 to be resisting any commitment to end financing of all new oil, gas and coal exploration projects this year.Putting big investors in charge of saving the planet might seem tantamount to putting a fox in charge of the henhouse.Anyone who lived through the 2008 financial crisis can recall that it was prompted by the reckless mortgage investments of big banks looking for easy profits. It was left to governments to use taxpayer money to bring the world financial system back from the brink.Left to its own devices, investment money inevitably seeks out the most profitable projects, regardless of the implications for wider society. Big tobacco and big oil are among the sectors that have sought to maximize their profits by resisting pressure to limit the damage they cause.Developed capitalist societies have also tended to prioritize the concept of shareholder value, in which returns on investment are seen as more important than the goods and services any given company produces or the way it treats its employees and customers.That raises the question of whether the world can rely on the goodwill of asset managers and big corporations to do the right thing when it comes to the climate issue, or whether legislation will be required instead.Carney acknowledged ahead of COP26 that a privately funded green transition plan would also require governments to implement clear and credible net-zero policies.""This includes carbon pricing, bans on internal combustion vehicles, national targets to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, and mandatory climate-related financial disclosures,"" he wrote in an opinion piece in the Financial Times.He invited investors to assess who was part of the proposed$100 trillion green transition revolution and to ask whether it includes their bank, insurer, mutual fund manager or pension fund. His remarks were an invitation to investors themselves to keep the banks and asset managers to their commitments.Investors and the corporations they finance have had to burnish their green credentials in recent years, reflecting pressure from ethical investors who demand societal benefits as well as a return on their money.Business leaders as well as world leaders have descended on Glasgow for COP26 in part to convince customers and investors that they are doing their bit for the planet.Some climate campaigners have dismissed such tactics as ""green-washing"", a phenomenon linked more to image building than to genuine climate action. Activists challenge the credibility of banks that continue to finance fossil fuels.While the jury is still out on whether COP26 will be judged as a success, Swedish activist Greta Thunberg and her supporters have already declared it a failure. Perhaps with the banks in mind, she declared: ""It should be obvious that we cannot solve the crisis with the same methods that got us into it in the first place.""The author is a senior media consultant for China Daily UK.The views do not necessarily reflect those of China Daily.",Copyright 2021 China Daily Information.

Current national plans fall far short of that target, and British officials have made ""keeping 1.5 C alive"" the mantra of COP26.Read more: At COP26, Ugandan Vanessa Nakate's powerful voice helps reframe climate activismToronto school board rejects Marie Henein book-club eventThe organizer of a book club for teenage girls says she was told students from the Toronto District School Board would not attend one of her events because the featured author, lawyer Marie Henein, had defended Jian Ghomeshi on sexual-assault charges.The board now says that was a misunderstanding.A Room of Your Own Book Club invites teenage girls, many of whom come from low-income families, to read a text and then discuss it in a virtual space with the author.

The officer, Constable Doug Snelgrove, assaulted her in her own apartment, she said, after he offered her a ride home from a bar. The story she told would take more than six years and three trials to prove. Now, her case is forcing changes to policing in Newfoundland, and has created a crisis around the future of the RNC, a 400-officer organization dating back to 1729 that has long been a celebrated part of the province's history.Judge dismisses Maxime Bernier's defamation case against Warren Kinsella over Project Cactus campaign: An Ontario Superior Court judge has dismissed Maxime Bernier's lawsuit against political columnist Warren Kinsella, ruling that the People's Party Leader failed to prove his defamation concerns outweighed the importance of protecting free speech in the political realm. In 2019, the Conservative Party had hired Kinsella and his consulting firm, Daisy Group, to run a ""seek and destroy"" effort called Project Cactus that aimed to discredit Bernier and his new party.SNC-Lavalin CEO cancels public appearance as language debate in Quebec intensifies: SNC-Lavalin's CEO Ian Edwards cancelled a largely English-language speech he was expected to deliver in Montreal next week amid growing scrutiny over the French-language abilities of Quebec's anglophone business leaders.

His father was a low-paid police clerk; his mother took odd jobs cleaning and mending. The family could not afford glasses for the short-sighted Auguste: He found school painful but took refuge in drawing. After training at a trade school for artisans, he was rejected three times by the \xC9cole des Beaux-Arts and underwent a long apprenticeship, crafting figures for buildings and monuments and creating small commercial figurines. In 1864, the official Salon, which still favoured allegorical and narrative sculpture, rejected The Man with the Broken Nose, the well-worn face of an old workman modelled in clay. It was not until 1877 that Rodin achieved fame with a shockingly lifelike nude male figure titled The Age of Bronze. That marked the beginnings of a three-dimensional art whose rough surfaces, weighty forms and psychological penetration would signal the arrival of modern sculpture. At his death in 1917, Rodin was still working on The Gates of Hell for a proposed museum, a frieze of figures that included The Thinker, one of the most familiar sculptures in the world.

178,PROMOTING ESG TO ALIGN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY TO NEW STAKEHOLDER DEMANDS,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,City A.M.,News,1435,NEWS;Pg. 11,1435,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,,,,,PROMOTING ESG TO ALIGN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY TO NEW STAKEHOLDER DEMANDS,"The global re/insurance industry faces both asset and liability exposure to the climate crisis, as well as opportunities to drive meaningful progress towards global resilience. As a result, insurance and reinsurance are crucial elements in a successful and inclusive transition to a green economy, helping clients to implement ESG mandates, as well as focusing on their own ESG protocols. However, to drive real progress, re/insurance needs alignment and clarity from policymakers which will hopefully materialise during this week's Cop26… The US state of Texas, with its bonedry dustbowls, desert dunes and tumblin' tumbleweeds, isn't a place usually associated with polar vortexes and Arctic snowstorms. Yet, that's exactly what happened in February this year, when ferocious winter weather blanketed swaths of the Lone Star State, causing electricity blackouts, burst water-pipes and 210 deaths. The chaotic conditions also resulted in the most expensive insurance payout for cold weather ever: a record $15bn (£11bn).It highlights the capricious vagaries of the climate crisis in 2021, which has been something of an annus mirabilis for extreme weather: suffocating heatwaves in Canada and the US northwest, the highest-ever recorded temperature in Europe (48.8C in Sicily), devastating floods in Germany and never-seen-before snowfalls in Spain.According to professional services firm Aon, the litany of disasters during the first half of 2021 will see insurers pay out $42bn (£31bn) for insured losses: the largest amount of compensation paid since the 2011 Japanese tsunami. But like John Dryden's famously poem of the same name, 2021 could be a year that (finally) drives global stakeholders to make meaningful and lasting change.""The rise in extreme weather and claims has accelerated the importance of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues within the insurance industry,"" says Meredith Jones, Aon's Global Head of ESG. ""Today, ESG is no longer a niche area for many insurance firms, but an indispensable part of their risk management and opportunity development framework.""But while the ever-evolving insurance and reinsurance industry can play a pivotal role in the transition to a green economy, as we find out here, progress will be slow without the help of governments and regulatory bodies. With the Cop26 climate conference currently taking place in Glasgow, it's hoped ESG will be pushed further up the agenda with climate change disclosure and targets becoming mandatory and more uniform.WHAT ROLE DOES THE RE/INSURANCE INDUSTRY PLAY IN THE CLIMATE CRISIS? A pretty big one. For a start, industry underwriters have been using advanced weather forecasting and detection technologies for decades; its risk management expertise on meteorological anomalies is second-to-none. As such, re/insurers can advise policymakers on climate change (adaptation) and give guidance to national economies hoping to meet carbon-neutral 2050 pledges (mitigation) . The industry can also help businesses and individuals in developing countries too, many of which are uninsured and therefore more vulnerable when extreme weather events happen. In the past decade, only 12% of economic losses in Asia were covered by insurance (in Latin America and Africa, almost all losses were uninsured). In the aftermath of a destructive typhoon or flood, local businesses and individuals find recovery difficult as they're often dependent upon state or international aid. With many weather events such as hurricanes or drought being modelable, being insured will help build global economic resilience, perhaps even ending the never-ending cycle of disaster and aid.In 2020 Aon found the global ""protection gap"" - the difference between the economic costs of natural disasters and the value of assets covered by insurance - reached $171bn (£124bn). This could be reduced via tools such as catastrophe bonds. Known more commonly as cat-bonds, this insurance is paid out following a natural disaster, if certain conditions are met. It's increasingly popular with investors and corporations, who get their money back (with interest) if the tragedy does not strike. HOW ARE STAKEHOLDERS DRIVING THE IMPORTANCEOF ESG ISSUES IN THE RE/INSURANCE INDUSTRY? Stakeholders such as employees, society and investors increasingly expect companies to incorporate ESG in their everyday activities, often scrutinising and screening them on how they address environmental, social or governance issues. For examples, investors placed a record amount of assets into ESG or sustainable mutual funds in 2020 ($51.1b), making it the fifth consecutive year of record-breaking investments as well as double 2019's total haul, according to Morningstar.Investors and regulatory bodies are also increasingly demanding that companies report on their ESG and climate change risks, such as use of water and electricity and diversity. In the UK, this could happen within the next five years. Last year, the government announced it will be mandatory for large companies (including many insurance firms) to declare their exposure to climate risks by 2025. Such disclosures may even lead to litigation, and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has already seen cases double just over the last three years.As ESG and climate change risks become clearer, rating agencies such as AM Best and DBRS Morningstar are evaluating insurers on how they implement ESG risk management too.WHAT IS THE RE/INSURANCE INDUSTRY DOING TO IMPROVE ITS ESG CREDENTIALS? Alongside ESG commitments towards net zero, diversity and workforce resilience, Aon has also established the Aon ESG Think Tank, a worldwide coalition of more than 80 employees, who work to provide innovative insurance, investment, and disclosure solutions for its clients on climate change and ESG. The business is also leveraging its weather-related data and expertise by providing catastrophe, climate change and economic models to help better identify the risks associated with global warming.Many re/insurance firms have pulled their cover for oil, gas, hydrogen and nuclear power companies. Insurers are also adding 'build back better' clauses to home insurance policies to encourage customers to rebuild homes with more sustainable materials. As mentioned above, re/insurance organisations are also increasingly identifying exposure to climate-risks through annual financial and sustainability reports. There could be more industry-wide collaboration too. The industry has more than $30tn of investments; earlier this year the ClimateWise coalition of insurers (which includes Aon) proposed this sum could be used to help governments build resilient solutions to floods, storms and heatwaves. Meanwhile, the Sustainable Market Initiative Insurance Taskforce (which comprises 17 organisations including Aon) has pledged to expand insurance coverage for projects such as offshore windfarms and provide better disaster protection cover for those countries most at risk from extreme weather.WHAT DOES THE RE/INSURANCE INDUSTRY HOPE WILL BE ACHIEVED AT COP26? ""We'd like all participants, whether they are insurers, governments, corporate issuers or investors, to not only commit to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees, but outline concrete and unambiguous plans to meet this goal,""says Meredith Jones. ""Cop26 isn't going to solve the issue of climate change on its own, but it can move us towards agreement on disclosure, targets, metrics and timelines, and encourage innovation and product evolution through the risk financing chain.""HOW CAN AON HELP COMPANIES MEET THEIR ESG COMMITMENTS? ""Aon has an extensive range of data and analytic capabilities that can help clients make better and more sustainable decisions,"" says Jones. This data and analysis - which includes risk tools, climate change scenarios and models, peer data and pattern recognition - can help identify ESG and climate risks and opportunities for clients, and help them mitigate and disclose risks as well. Aon's global team of advisers can work with companies on ESG topics ranging from climate change to diversity, equity and inclusion, and the firm has some innovative products up its sleeve as well.""Insurance and reinsurance are key components of the global risk financing required to successfully navigate the climate crisis,"" says Jones. ""Our industries can serve as both an instrument and accelerator for mitigation and adaptation efforts, and by developing innovative re/insurance solutions, we can help ensure an inclusive transition towards a sustainable future."" £TO FIND OUT MORE, VISIT:WWW.AON.COM/COP26",Copyright 2021 City A.M.

180,US and China stun with joint climate change pact,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Sydney Morning Herald (Australia),News,890,NEWS;Pg. 12,890,Australia,Nick O'Malley and Bevan Shields,,,,US and China stun with joint climate change pact,"Glasgow: The shock new pact between China and the United States unveiled in Glasgow has been hailed as a breakthrough as the deadline looms for the climate summit's negotiations.The world's two largest emitters declared global warming an existential crisis which demands co-operation between the superpowers.In a boost to the flagging COP26 talks and sign of a possible thawing in the fractured relationship between both countries, Chinese climate envoy Xie Zhenhua and his US counterpart John Kerry stunned observers by unveiling the joint declaration pledging tougher action this decade.The agreement between the world's two largest emitters was negotiated in secret for months during about 30 virtual meetings and negotiation sessions in Shanghai, London and Washington before final terms were settled in Glasgow on Wednesday night local-time. ""Co-operation is the only choice for both China and the United States,"" Xie told reporters via a translator.""By working together, our two countries can achieve many important things that are beneficial not only to our two countries, but to the world as a whole. As two major powers in the world, China and the US shoulder special international responsibilities and obligations.""We need to think big and feel responsible. We need to work ... hard to promote world peace and development. We need to actively address climate change through cooperation, bringing benefits to both our two peoples and peoples around the world.""The announcement appeared to take Britain, the host of the COP26 summit, by surprise given Prime Minister Boris Johnson had only hours earlier warned momentum at the talks was slowing.The Glasgow declaration was released a week after US President Joe Biden attacked Chinese President Xi Jinping for not attending the summit in person, describing it as a ""big mistake"".""The rest of the world is going to look to China and say, 'what value added are they providing?""' Mr Biden said last week. ""They've lost the ability to influence the people around the world and all the people here at COP.""The document released on Wednesday promises the US and China will work together on emissions reductions and an accelerated phase-out of unabated coal, however timelines were not listed. The statement also binds China to tackle damaging methane emissions and deforestation, while both countries have agreed to share technology and expertise on clean energy, decarbonisation and electrification.The statement notes both countries are committed to the Paris Agreement goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5 degrees and conceded there was a ""gap"" between current policies and meeting that core target.Mr Xie described climate change as an ""existential crisis"" and said agreement between the US and China on how to deal with global warming far outweighed their differences on the issue.Mr Kerry, a former US secretary of state under Barack Obama, framed the surprise agreement as much-needed momentum for the COP26 talks.""The two largest economies in the world have agreed to work together to raise climate ambition in this decisive decade,"" Mr Kerry told reporters in Glasgow.""Our teams have worked together for months, and we have worked in good faith. We have found common ground.""Mr Kerry described the joint declaration, titled the China-US Joint Glasgow Declaration on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s, as a ""road map for our present and future collaboration"" on climate change.""It declares specifically and identifies the need to accelerate the transition to a global net-zero economy,"" Mr Kerry said.""Secondly, it commits to a series of important actions, not out in the long term but now, in this decade where it's needed.""We could leave [Glasgow] on Friday not working together, the world wondering where the future is going,"" he said.""Or we can leave here with people working together in order to raise the ambition and move down a better road.""What President Biden wanted to do, and President Xi agreed we should do, is join together to work at trying to solve this. And I am convinced that's a better road to pursue.""Mr Xie and Mr Kerry noted that the US had developed a plan to reduce methane emissions and said China would follow suit.""Climate change is a common challenge faced by humanity. It bears on the wellbeing of future generations,"" Mr Xie said.""Climate change is becoming increasingly urgent and severe.""Laurence Tubiana, a key architect of the Paris Agreement and chief executive officer of the European Climate Foundation, said the joint declaration proved co-operation on climate was possible.""The methane and forests commitments are good news, now they must co-operate on ensuring an ambitious outcome to COP26,"" she said.""That means putting us on track to 1.5 degrees and delivering the vital support needed to those most vulnerable. The success of that co-operation will be judged on the outcome of this vital meeting.""Bernice Lee, the research director at the Chatham House think tank in London, also sounded a note of caution.""It can only be good news that the US and China are working closely on climate change and slashing methane emissions,"" Ms Lee said. ""Details remain patchy but this declaration should dissolve any fears that US-China tensions will stand in the way of success at COP26. But the statement is not enough to close the deal.""",Copyright 2021 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|CLIMATE CHANGECLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION & POLICYAGREEMENTSEMISSIONSGLOBAL WARMINGINTERNATIONAL RELATIONSENVIRONMENTAL TREATIES & AGREEMENTSSTATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICESINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS & NATIONAL SECURITYDEFORESTATIONGREENHOUSE GASESUS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020CARBON NEUTRAL ENERGYGOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERSHEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENTPRIME MINISTERS|EMISSIONSGLOBAL WARMINGENERGY & UTILITIESMETHANEDEFORESTATIONCARBON NEUTRAL ENERGY|BARACK OBAMAJOE BIDENJOHN KERRYXI JINPINGBORIS JOHNSON|GLASGOW, SCOTLANDSHANGHAI, CHINASYDNEY, AUSTRALIALONDON, ENGLAND|EAST CHINA|UNITED STATESCHINAAUSTRALIA",
181,What It’s Like Covering the Most Anticipated Climate Conference in Years;Times Insider,"November 12, 2021 Friday",New York,The New York Times,News,1100,INSIDER,1100,,Megan DiTrolio,,,,What It’s Like Covering the Most Anticipated Climate Conference in YearsTimes Insider,"Two Times journalists on the ground in Glasgow — one who is at her first climate conference, and another who is covering her 10th — share what it’s like on the inside of the event.Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.The United Nations climate change conference known as COP26 officially comes to an end on Friday, as nearly 200 nations try to finalize an agreement to tackle global warming. World leaders, climate experts and activists gathered in Glasgow to galvanize countries into preventing the average global temperature from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. COP26 is the 10th climate conference Lisa Friedman, a reporter on our Climate desk, has covered. It is the first for Lyndsey Layton, the desk’s deputy editor.In separate interviews, they discussed lost luggage, The Times’s approach to coverage, and why, despite some criticism, summits such as COP26 are important for making change. Their answers have been edited and condensed.When did you arrive at the conference?LISA FRIEDMAN I arrived on Saturday, Oct. 30. My luggage arrived the next night — my flight was delayed, and while we all made our connecting flight to Glasgow, none of our luggage did. I leave on Nov. 14, the Sunday after the conference is supposed to officially close. After 10 times covering this, I know that it sometimes goes into many, many hours of overtime, so I wanted to give myself a little breathing room to do stories and tell readers what it all came to and meant.Is the conference different from what you were expecting?LYNDSEY LAYTON I didn’t really quite know what to expect. This may sound obvious, but it’s one thing to have edited so many stories about the global nature of climate change. It’s another to come to a place like this and hear all these languages. People have come from all over the planet, concerned about this problem and are working on it and trying to find a way forward.What is different about COP26 compared with conferences that you’ve covered in the past?FRIEDMAN The most important one to compare this to is in 2015, when countries signed the Paris Agreement. There, you had the head of the United Nations climate body and lawmakers marching with activists down the streets of Paris and New York ahead of the conference, promising to work together to form an agreement. Since then, we have seen countries not really live up to what they promised. There’s a lot more anger and frustration from developing countries and from environmental activists that the moment is not being met. I’d say that there’s a lot more pressure on countries to not just make promises, but to show that they’re really acting.What’s the energy like at the conference?LAYTON I’ve had some really interesting conversations. To give you a sense of the variety of issues: I spoke with a Scottish member of Parliament who comes from an old coal mining town, and the coal mine is shut down. His people are struggling. I asked, “What do they think of climate change?” And he said, “They don’t care.” He said, “Climate change is a middle-class issue. My people are worried about food on the table, a roof over their heads and a way to make a living.” That dilemma is something that is in West Virginia, too. If this country transitions to green energy, there will be displacement. There will be people and communities that are going to suffer. The question is, how do you prop those up? How do you bring in new employment, new activity? It’s so interesting to be able to meet people here who are experiencing the challenges and the impacts of climate change in different ways. What kinds of precautions did you take against Covid-19?FRIEDMAN Our team had a number of calls on safety protocol before we came. We all came armed with masks and hand sanitizer. Once here, the protocol is supposed to be that you take a rapid test and you register your results with the National Health Service and you can only get in once you show negative results. That adds a logistical layer getting in. Inside, everything is pretty distant and spaced and people are wearing masks in the hallway, but it’s also a conference of more than 30,000 people doing work, so masks come off and there are scrums.There are still risks. There have been reports of people testing positive. Both the United Nations climate body and the British presidency of the conference had been really not transparent at all about cases. As journalists, we all find it really troubling, the lack of transparency about the numbers. That’s been an issue here.How does the collective focus on shared goals make you feel?LAYTON There are so many issues; it’s such a complex problem. And every nation that comes has its own set of particular issues and concerns and its own internal politics. Like the United States — we’re very divided over climate policy, as are so many other nations. There’s so much to discuss and these little conversations are happening between negotiators in rooms that we can’t access. You don’t really have eyes into the real meat of the discussions; you’re just trying to follow the bouncing ball and trying to pick up intel here and there. It’s very hard to get the overall view of what’s really happening. That’s the challenge that our reporters have.How do you create coverage that really stands out?LAYTON We started planning for this way in advance, months and months and months ago, to figure out what would be the emerging themes. We started thinking about this a long time ago and Hannah Fairfield, the Climate editor, has been super organized. We had a game plan coming into COP26. We had a number of stories that we published before we even got to Scotland. Then we had a plan going in for stories we wanted to do here in addition to whatever news we could break.There’s a question circulating online on whether the summit is effective. Is that refrain hitting the summit?FRIEDMAN I have seen some of that. But, no summit, no conference, can solve everything. These conferences are forcing moments. Countries and leaders are put on the spot and they have to commit to things. And then they are on the record committing to these things and we can see whether they make good on their pledges or not. As problematic as some of the charges are, without these big summits, without the eyes of the world on leaders, you wouldn’t get new commitments.PHOTO: Nearly 200 nations are represented in Glasgow at a conference to combat climate change.

183,"Beijing, Washington ink joint climate declaration","November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Phnom Penh Post (Cambodia),News,769,,769,"Cambodia, Kingdom of",,,,,"Beijing, Washington ink joint climate declaration","China and the US have signed a joint declaration to address the global climate crisis during the next decade, marking one of the most significant breakthroughs yet to come out of the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland. The declaration, which is called the US-China Joint Glasgow Declaration on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s, was announced on the evening of November 10 by China's special climate envoy, Xie Zhenhua, and US special presidential envoy for climate, John Kerry. The move took many onlookers in Glasgow by surprise, with the media alerted to a joint news conference just an hour before it started. Several world leaders have labelled this year's COP as the most important since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015, and a Sino-US declaration is sure to send a strong signal to all delegations in attendance. Xie said the problem of global warming is ""increasingly urgent and severe"" and that climate change threatens an ""existential crisis"". ""In the area of climate change, there is more agreement between the US and China than divergence, making it an area with huge potential for our cooperation,"" Xie said. ""As two major powers, both China and the US shoulder international responsibilities and obligations. We need to think big."" Kerry said the current time represents a ""critical decade"" in the fight to combat global warming. ""The US and China have no shortage of differences, but on climate, cooperation is the only way to get things done,"" Kerry said. ""We cannot reach our goals without countries working together, and China and the US in particular, as the two largest emitters in the world, both have to help show the way."" In the joint declaration, both sides reaffirmed their commitment under the Paris Agreement to ""hold the global average temperature increase to well below 2C and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5C"". The two countries also agreed to cooperate closely during the next 10 years on a range of climate-related issues, including methane emissions, fossil fuel reduction, and clean energy technologies. UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres called the declaration an ""important step in the right direction"". ""I welcome today's agreement between China and the US to work together to take more ambitious climate action in this decade,"" Guterres said on Twitter. ""Tackling the climate crisis requires international collaboration and solidarity."" European Commission first vice-president Frans Timmermans said on Twitter that bilateral cooperation between China and the US ""should boost negotiations at COP26"". China and the US said they intend to establish a Working Group on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s, which will meet regularly to ""address the climate crisis and advance the multilateral process, focusing on enhancing concrete actions in this decade"". In the declaration, the US cited domestic targets to reduce methane emissions, and China announced its own plans for a ""comprehensive and ambitious National Action Plan on methane"", aiming to achieve significant emissions control and reductions in the 2020s. Also on November 10, COP26 president Alok Sharma published a first draft of the proposed Glasgow agreement, which parties will aim to reach at this year's conference, after further negotiations. The draft called on countries to accelerate the phasing out of both coal and fossil fuel subsidies, neither of which has been mentioned in previous COP agreements. The document also included stronger language on the warming target of 2 to 1.5 degrees, which was set in Paris six years ago. The draft ""recognises that the impacts of climate change will be much lower at the temperature increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to 2 degrees, and resolves to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees"". Wang Yi, a senior scientific adviser in China's delegation at COP26, told China Daily on November 10 that adjusting this target could have a disruptive knock-on effect. ""If we decrease the indicator, the target, to 1.5 only, that means we must change the whole Paris Agreement,"" Wang said. Last week special climate envoy Xie said it is important to honour what was decided on in Paris, calling the agreement ""science-based, rule-based, inclusive and realistic"". Sharma said that the draft is not offering decisive language on the target. ""I also want to be clear we are not seeking to reopen the Paris Agreement,"" Sharma said on November 10. ""The Paris Agreement clearly sets out the temperature goal well below 2C and pursuing efforts towards 1.5C.""

187,CAN DO..

MUST DOSturgeon calls on rich countries to step up in the last hours of climate change summit but Friends of the Earth says Scotland must do more to end gas & oil production,"NICOLA Sturgeon has called for a ""can-do"" attitude at COP26 as delegates enter last-minute talks to secure a deal they hope will save the planet.The First Minister said all leaders at the SEC in Glasgow must ""step up"" and secure a meaningful agreement between nations that would limit rising temperatures.And the SNP leader announced the Scottish Government would treble its own climate justice fund, which offers financial support to the world's poorest communities.But she was accused by environmentalists of preferring to have her photo taken with Greta Thunberg to signing the new Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance.Sturgeon has been a visible presence at the summit on Clydeside but is not a formal member of the UK Government team of ministers trying to hammer out a deal with other countries.Calling on larger countries to adopt a ""can-do"" attitude, the First Minister said: ""Every vulnerable or developing country I have spoken with has big ambitions for meeting the climate crisis but they do not have the funding for adaptation, for mitigation, or for tackling the loss and damage that is needed.""Twelve years on from the commitment by developed nations to provide funding of $100billion a year, that is simply not good enough.""It is time for leaders of developed countries, large and small, to do what is needed to bridge the remaining gap and put on the table now the money that is needed to make good on past commitments and unlock progress in other areas.""Sturgeon said that Scotland ""is a relatively small country of just five million people"".She added: ""However, we can still lead by example and there has never been a more vital time to do so.""All of my conversations with delegates from the global south over these two weeks - and the obvious need to increase the overall ambition of the draft cover text published yesterday - have convinced me that rich countries must do more on finance in the final hours of COP if we are to secure the best possible outcome. That is not charity, it is our obligation.""Accordingly, the ScottishGovernment, having already committed to doubling our climate justice fund to £24million in this Parliament, has now decided to increase it by a further £12million.""She went on: ""This increased funding will also build on our groundbreaking contribution to loss and damage, by doubling our contribution to addressing loss and damage to £2million.""My message today is simple. If Scotland can up its contribution, there is no good reason why the larger developed countries … cannot do so, too.""However, Sturgeon had her own environmental storm to deal with after Friends of the Earth accused her of being all talk and little action after failing to sign up to a commitment to reduce oil and gas production.The SNP leader has been pictured at COP26 with activist Greta Thunberg and broadcaster Sir David Attenborough. She also posted a photo of herself handing a can of Irn-Bru to US politician Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.Richard Dixon, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, was furious that she had not signed Scotland up to the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, which was launched at the SEC summit yesterday.Dixon said: ""Nicola Sturgeon is keen to use the language of climate justice and be photographed with Greta Thunberg.""But at some point her fine rhetoric has to translate into a commitment to stopping the oil and gas production that is driving the climate crisis.""Refusing to join the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance is a failure to follow through on her Government's recent change of position to no longer support unlimited oil and gas extraction.""Sturgeon denied that she was at COP26 for photos and insisted she was in Glasgow to promote Scottish interests.She said: ""I haven't had many selfies, I don't have a new best, best friend. I've been trying to do two things here. I've been trying to do whatever they can, albeit relatively small, to push the negotiations in the right direction.""She insisted Scotland was ""in a different position"" to other devolved administrations such as Wales, which has backed the commitment.In the last nine days, the First Minister has retweeted or posted 65 snaps or clips of herself on Twitter, however the total at COP is 84 in 11 days.She told reporters at COP26 yesterday: ""Friends of the Earth Scotland is a very good campaigning organisation and their job is to push governments in the direction they think governments should go, and they do it well.""But I'm the First Minister - I've got to do more than simply state a position.""We have to go through a process of what level we are going to join.""I don't disagree with Friends of the Earth on the destination we are trying to get to.""My job is to get us to that destination in a fair and a just way.""She added: ""Wales is in a different position to Scotland when it comes to oil and gas.""I welcome their commitment but we are in a different position in terms of the size and reality of our oil and gas sector.""",Copyright 2021 Copyright © 2021 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|DRC|ENGLISH|FRIENDS OF THE EARTH|National Edition|CLIMATE CHANGEENVIRONMENTAL & WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONSENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICEAGREEMENTSSCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTYGOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCESNEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSNEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWSNEGATIVE NEWSENVIRONMENTALISM|OIL & GAS INDUSTRY|NICOLA STURGEONGRETA THUNBERG|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|SCOTLANDUNITED KINGDOM",
188,Can world's climate target and India's development coexist?,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),News,920,NEWS;Version:1,920,England & Wales,Via AP news wire,,,,Can world's climate target and India's development coexist?,"India  faces a difficult choice that will have consequences for the world.No country's energy needs are expected to grow faster in coming decades than India's. Even under the most optimistic projections, a part of the demand must be met by dirty coal power --a key source of heat trapping carbon emissions.India can either compromise on development needed to lift millions from poverty, or it can continue burning coal from the country's vast domestic reserves, said India's top environmental official Rameshwar Prasad Gupta in New Delhi, the week before the United Nations  climate summit at Glasgow, known as COP26.With just days remaining for the crucial talks, a fundamental question remains: Will there be enough ""carbon space"" in the atmosphere for India's developmental needs to coexist with the global ambition of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times.Last week, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi  announced that the country would aim to stop adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere by 2070 --two decades after the U.S., and at least 10 years later than China  But this will only shave off a tenth of a degree of the world's warming, said climate scientist Niklas Hohne, of the NewClimate Institute and the Climate Action Tracker.And India's short-term targets for 2030 --increasing its current capacity of non-fossil fuel electricity to 500 gigawatts and using green energy to meet half of its needs, cutting carbon emissions by a billion tons compared with previous targets, and reducing the carbon intensity of its economy by 45% --wouldn't have any impact, said Hohne.But experts said these goals are ambitious for India, considering its developmental status and will be far from easy.For instance, India will have to triple its non-fossil fuel capacity in less than a decade. And for that, its power sector will have to completely reimagine itself. States, whose entire economies have centered around coal for centuries, will have to diversify. Land, which is in short supply in the crowded subcontinent, will be required for sprawling solar parks. ""It's a humongous task for a country like India,"" said Sandeep Pai, who studies energy security and climate change at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D,C.Even then, it may not be enough for the world.Despite their ""net zero"" emissions targets, China, the United States and the European Union  will take up 90% of the remaining carbon space to limit warming to 1.5 degrees by 2050, according to an analysis by the India think tank Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) released Sunday. But if they were to advance their targets by a decade, more than 110 billion tons of carbon dioxide for developing nations - or a third of the remaining carbon budget - would be available for developing nations.""You can't develop, if you don't have the carbon space,"" said Arunabha Ghosh, CEEW's chief executive. And because of its vast population, India's energy choices have an oversized impact for the world. There are 27 million people without access to electricity. It has roads and homes to build, while extreme heat is driving up the demand for air conditioning. To fulfil these needs, India will need to build a power system the size of the entire European Union's. Although India accounts for the most annual emissions after China and the U.S., its negotiators in Glasgow have, time and again, pointed out that they have historically contributed a fraction of the world's emissions. Moreover, they say, the typical American uses 12 times more electricity than the average Indian.Indian environment and climate change minister Bhupender Yadav told the Associated Press in an interview Wednesday it's a matter of ""conscience"" and said those countries historically responsible for emissions need to keep their unfulfilled promise of providing climate finance. Modi said earlier at the summit that India expected the world's developed nations to make $1 trillion available as climate finance. As things stand right now, the climate finance from rich nations to align with the 1.5 degrees Celsius target is ""nowhere to be seen,"" said Chirag Gajjar, a climate expert at the World Resources Institute. It's possible for the goal of 1.5 degrees and India's development needs to coexist, said climate scientist Hohne. What is key, he said, is not building any new coal-fired power plants anywhere in the world, including India, and shutting ""some coal-fired power plants"" before their time.  A transition away from coal, especially for coal-dependent regions of the world, would require the assistance of the international community, Hohne added.Asked about coal, India environment minister Yadav said the country had no immediate plans to phase it out. ""All the issues come and get stuck in climate finance."" ___For more AP climate coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/climate___ Follow Aniruddha Ghosal on Twitter: @aniruddhg1___The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Every step matters right now and we have a long journey ahead of us,"" Kerry said at a news conference.'Good news'Last week US President Joe Biden said Chinese leader Xi Jinping had ""walked away"" from the climate crisis for skipping the COP26 summit. China hit back at the time, but ties appear to have thawed ahead of long-awaited bilateral talks next week.""The release of this joint declaration shows that cooperation is the only choice for China and the US,"" said Xie.Al Jazeera's Shihab Rattansi, reporting from Washington, DC, said the countries' pledge to set up a working group to address climate change ""in the 2020s"" has been welcomed. ""This is specifically about the short-term, when action is the most crucial,"" he said.Rattansi also said the upcoming meeting between Biden and Xi could add to the sense of optimism spurred by Wednesday's climate agreement.Frans Timmermans, the European Commission's executive vice president for the European Green Deal, said the deal ""shows that the United States and China can cooperate on issues that transcend other conflicts"".""Humanity is faced with the biggest challenge we've had ever, which is the climate crisis, and now China and the US are going to cooperate more closely,"" Timmermans told Al Jazeera from the conference in Glasgow. ""And this is completely in line with what we need to do here at COP, so I really welcome this joint declaration, I think it's good news for us.""UN chief Antonio Guterres also said the US-China initiative was an ""important step"" in the fight against climate change.The news follows the release of a United Nations final draft communique - which while being lauded for highlighting the need to end fossil fuel subsidies for the first time, was criticised for the lack of accountability provisions and vague commitments on cutting greenhouse gas emissions.On Tuesday, the Climate Action Tracker research group noted in a report that under current climate pledges, the average global temperature will warm up to 2.4C by 2100 - a level that would be catastrophic.Britain's Alok Sharma, the COP26 president, acknowledged that ""significant issues remain unresolved"".""My big, big ask of all of you is to please come armed with the currency of compromise,"" he told negotiators. ""What we agree in Glasgow will set the future for our children and grandchildren, and I know that we will not want to fail them.""Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

193,"China, US ink joint climate declaration","November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Shenzhen Daily,News,707,,707,"China, People's Republic of",,Copyright 2021 Benchmark Information LimitedAll Rights Reserved,,,"China, US ink joint climate declaration","CHINA and the United States have signed a joint declaration to address the global climate crisis during the next decade, marking one of the most significant breakthroughs yet to come out of the United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP26, in Glasgow, Scotland.    The declaration, which is called the U.S.-China Joint Glasgow Declaration on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s, was announced Wednesday evening by China’s special climate envoy, Xie Zhenhua, and U.S. special presidential envoy for climate, John Kerry.    The move took many onlookers in Glasgow by surprise, with the media alerted to a joint news conference just an hour before it started. Several world leaders have labeled this year’s COP as the most important since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015, and a U.S.-China declaration is sure to send a strong signal to all delegations in attendance.    Xie said that the problem of global warming is “increasingly urgent and severe” and that climate change threatens an “existential crisis.”    “In the area of climate change, there is more agreement between the U.S. and China than divergence, making it an area with huge potential for our cooperation,” Xie said. “As two major powers, both China and the U.S. shoulder international responsibilities and obligations. We need to think big.”    Kerry said the current time represents a “critical decade” in the fight to combat global warming.    “The U.S. and China have no shortage of differences, but on climate, cooperation is the only way to get things done,” Kerry said. “We cannot reach our goals without countries working together, and China and the U.S. in particular, as the two largest emitters in the world, both have to help show the way.”    In the joint declaration, both sides reaffirmed their commitment under the Paris Agreement to “hold the global average temperature increase to well below 2 degrees Celsius and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius.”    The two countries also agreed to cooperate closely during the next 10 years on a range of climate-related issues, including methane emissions, fossil fuel reduction, and clean energy technologies.    U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the declaration an “important step in the right direction.”    “I welcome today’s agreement between China and the U.S. to work together to take more ambitious climate action in this decade,” Guterres said on Twitter. “Tackling the climate crisis requires international collaboration and solidarity.”    European Commission Vice President Frans Timmermans said on Twitter that bilateral cooperation between the U.S. and China “should boost negotiations at COP26.”    China and the U.S. said they intend to establish a Working Group on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s, which will meet regularly to “address the climate crisis and advance the multilateral process, focusing on enhancing concrete actions in this decade.”    In the declaration, the U.S. cited domestic targets to reduce methane emissions, and China announced its own plans for a “comprehensive and ambitious National Action Plan on methane,” aiming to achieve significant emissions control and reductions in the 2020s.    Also on Wednesday, COP26 President Alok Sharma published a first draft of the proposed Glasgow agreement, which parties will aim to reach at this year’s conference, after further negotiations.    The draft called on countries to accelerate the phasing out of both coal and fossil fuel subsidies, neither of which has been mentioned in previous COP agreements. The document also included stronger language on the warming target of 2 to 1.5 degrees, which was set in Paris six years ago.    The draft “recognizes that the impacts of climate change will be much lower at the temperature increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to 2 degrees, and resolves to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees.”    Wang Yi, a senior scientific advisor in China’s delegation at COP26, told China Daily on Wednesday that adjusting this target could have a disruptive knock-on effect.    “If we decrease the indicator, the target, to 1.5 only, that means we must change the whole Paris Agreement,” Wang said.

194,Chuka Umunna interview: From rising star Labour MP to JPMorgan's ethical banker,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,standard.co.uk,News,895,BUSINESS;Version:1,895,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Oscar Williams-Grut,,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO,Chuka Umunna interview: From rising star Labour MP to JPMorgan's ethical banker,"What do you think of when you hear the name Chuka Umunna ? The Labour leadership bid ? The Change UK breakaway ? DJing in Ibiza ? Your first thought is unlikely to be ESG  - the ungainly term used by bankers  to describe well behaved companies. Yet that's what fills his days now. Since leaving politics  in 2019, Umunna has turned to the City of London  to reinvent himself as a specialist in ESG (short for environmental, social and governance). After a brief stint at advisory firm Edelman, the 43-year-old joined JPMorgan in February to head up the bank's ESG practice in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Umunna, who was MP for Streatham from 2010 to 2019, now spends most of his days advising big companies on how to make sure they are green, well governed, and treating people well. He's also charged with making sure JPMorgan is practising what it preaches. It's a big job: ESG was already hot but COP26 has supercharged interest in ethical and sustainable business. ""There has been nothing short of a revolution,"" Umunna says when we meet on the 31st floor of JPMorgan's Canary Wharf headquarters. The boom means Umunna has one of the busiest diaries at the bank. Finding time to meet is a squeeze. ""One of the things I actually love about the role is it's just so international,"" he says. ""I've had the opportunity to go and see clients from the UAE to Germany - I was in Stockholm last week."" Is all that air travel really good for the environment? ""We are conscious of that,"" he adds quickly. ""I mean, there's nowhere near as much travel [as there used to be]."" Umunna still has the easy charm and charisma that made him so promising in the Commons and led the press to dub him Britain's answer to Obama. If you didn't know he was an MP, you'd think he was a lifelong investment banker. His easy waltz into the upper echelons of the City may smack of the revolving door between politics and business. But Umunna argues he's well qualified: he was an employment lawyer in the City before becoming an MP and spent four years as shadow business secretary under Labour leader Ed Miliband. ""I've been involved in ESG in different forms for the last 20 years,"" he says. This is in fact Umunna's second stint at JPMorgan - he briefly worked there at the very beginning of his career in the equity derivatives division. What Umunna is peddling now would have been regarded ""not even peripherally [but] as truly radical"" by the traders and bankers he worked with back then. ""This was before the global financial crash. Things are very, very different."" Indeed, banks are now tying executive bonuses to green targets  - a far cry from the casino banking of the pre-2008 era.What's driven this seismic shift? As with many revolutions, it's the kids. ""I speak to asset managers and investors a lot,"" Umunna says. ""They're all saying things about this demographic change, this huge asset transfer from baby boomers to millennials and younger cohorts."" Young people today don't just want the family wealth to grow, they want their cash to save the world.""People who work in financial services are human beings as well,"" Umunna says. ""I've got a one-and a four-year-old and I genuinely do worry about what we will be bequeathing the future generations."" It's an alluring message but critics say it's just a sales pitch. ESG gets accused of being little more than a box ticking exercise that enables 'greenwashing'. ESG funds hold oil stocks , for example. Umunna rejects this but admits the sector has been a ""bit of a Wild West."" ""The labels which were attached to products and investments were fairly liberally used. I think now there is more scrutiny, because it's a maturing market. And investors have been more demanding.""Then there are the claims that the City and business more generally are moving too slowly. People like Umunna spend time helping oil and gas companies draw up plans on how to transition away from fossil fuels over the coming decades. Activists want them to ditch it now.Umunna calls this ""a kind of Twittersphere binary debate"". Reality is much more complex and thorny than that, he argues.""Oil and gas majors over decades have been responsible for lifting living standards and changing the way we all live. Some would have you believe that, some family that has had a history of working on an oil rig in the North Sea, somehow they're now terrible evil people because they are working for a fossil fuel company.""Umunna is an optimist. Understanding of the issues is developuing ""month to month"" in the City, he says, and cites pressure on companies from investors to develop science-based targets on going net zero. Aviva recently made headlines for threatening to divest from fossil fuel companies unless they got serious about transition, for example - something that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.""I think it's a terrible shame if this is simply seen as a kind of negative burden on society,"" Umunna says. ""I think it's a huge opportunity to change the way we live and is a business opportunity for many new companies and more established companies alike. There's a big positive story to be told here as well.""

195,Don't believe the greenwashing - the Tory government is a threat to our climate,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The National (Scotland),News,952,,952,England & Wales,Ross Greer,,FRIENDS OF THE EARTH,FRIENDS OF THE EARTH,Don't believe the greenwashing - the Tory government is a threat to our climate,"MY experience of the \xE2blue zone\xE2 at COP26 has been a mix of good, bad and outright greenwashing. In the time I was there I saw some truly inspirational stuff, particularly from those indigenous delegates able to access the venue. On the other hand, the most ridiculous sight I came across was the claim on the Australian government\xE2s booth that the arms trade is a \xE2green industry\xE2.Despite some of the understandable criticism, there are thousands of good people doing good work at COP26. Delegates from the Global South, representatives from NGOs like Christian Aid and even the negotiators from some Global North governments are truly trying to secure the best possible agreement.Unfortunately, those genuinely committed Global North governments are in the minority amongst rich nations, and it\xE2s the rich nations who dictate the outcome at COP \xE2 them and the 500 fossil fuel lobbyists also present.According to the COP26 Coalition \xE2 which represents indigenous movements and vulnerable communities around the world \xE2 around two-thirds of those it was helping to travel to Glasgow had to give up due to a combination of visa and accreditation problems, a lack of access to Covid vaccines and unaffordable accommodation.Some campaigners, including Friends of the Earth have branded it \xE2the most exclusionary COP ever"".We know that countries in the Global South pollute far less than the wealthiest countries, but they are already facing the worst effects of climate breakdown. Their voices cannot be excluded or marginalised.There have been some positive headline announcements, including funding for countries to transition away from coal, steps to end deforestation and US/China action on methane reduction.But they do not go far enough and, as things stand, the overall package looks like too little too late.Whatever is agreed, the key will be to ensure it is actually delivered. The 2009 COP conference committed to $100 billion of funding from the Global North to the South for adaptation and to mitigate the impact of climate breakdown, but less than a quarter of it has been delivered.READ MORE:\xC2Lesley Riddoch: It seems certain we were wrong all along about Boris JohnsonThis inaction is having devastating consequences. During the conference I spoke to Simeon Sawadogo, the environment minister of Burkina Faso. He told me about the impacts of climate breakdown in his country and the wider region, including increased floods in some regions, droughts in others and the loss of farmable land to the desert\xE2s expansion.Barack Obama struck a despondent note when he used his COP26 speech to claim that we must settle for \xE2imperfect compromise.\xE2But there\xE2s a huge difference between political compromise and failing to take the action that science says is required. The latter is a failure, not a compromise.This is supported by new analysis from the Climate Action Tracker, an independent scientific analysis website, that predicts commitments made during the summit will still lead to at least a 2.4 degrees temperature rise by 2100, which would mean a catastrophic level of global warming.The fossil fuel companies may not have the huge exhibition stands and ominous billboard campaigns that they usually have, but their fingerprints and presence are still all over the conference. Their 500-plus lobbyists are larger than any single nation\xE2s delegation.The so-called solutions pitched by these snake-oil salesmen are focused on maintaining the status quo and delaying the actions required, all for the sake of defending their obscene profits. We cannot rely on polluters to lead us to a low-carbon future. The corporations that have contributed so much to the crisis are not the ones who are going to solve it.The same goes for the governments who have allowed them to get away with so much destruction for so long. There has been no shortage of hot air from Downing Street. Boris Johnson called for COP tobe \xE2a turning point for the world\xE2 and warned that it is one minute to midnight for the climate crisis. He\xE2s right, but rather than lecturing the world he should be leading by example.Only one week before COP, the Chancellor Rishi Suank announced one of the most anti-climate budgets in years.With \xC221bn worth of spending on new roads, cuts to air passenger duty for domestic flights and a freeze on fuel duty, it took a wrecking ball to the UK\xE2s climate commitments. With the prospect of a new oil field off Shetland and a new coal mine in Cumbria, it was yet another reminder that the Tories and the values that they represent are a clear and present danger to both people and planet.As the official host the UK Government should be leading the calls for change, not derailing and undermining them. Even the most ambitious targets are completely meaningless when those setting them plan to burn even more fossil fuels and encourage more and more people to drive and fly.The loudest voices in the room may be failing to rise to the urgency of the moment, but the movement of young people, indigenous communities and activists around the world has been truly inspiring. Around 100,000 people took to the streets of Glasgow to call for real and meaningful change.

There is not enough clarity on the amount and source of climate cash or how it will be mobilised. Other elements, though, may be grounds for some cautious optimism. For instance, the draft text mentions fossil fuels for the first time in the nearly 30-year history of the United Nations climate conferences, with nations ""called upon"" to accelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels. But observers have noted the possibility that the sentence could be removed in the final iteration of the cover text as negotiations progress.

To PREVENT the most catastrophic consequences of global warming we must limit the increase to 1.5C.The climate must be at the centre of all of our political and economic decision making, yet the Tory GoVernment are failing to show the leadership we need.COP26 is a critical opportunity to secure a global agreement on the scale of climate action needed to SAVE our planet.I attended the conference last week and it was inspiring to meet with parliamentarians, experts and ACTIVISTS from across the world working on the solutions needed to preVent climate change.HoweVer, the UK GoVernment's last-minute preparations risk squandering the precious opportunity we haVe as the host nation.There is scant eVidence of a concerted diplomatic effort by the UK GoVernment oVer the past two years to secure the commitment at COP26 of the most polluting nations and to giVe confidence to the countries of the global south that the UK is committed to a just transition.The GoVernment's approach to the UK's own net zero challenge is also falling far short.Publishing a net zero strategy at the last minute before COP26, continuing to permit the exploration of new oilfields in the North Sea and a new coalmine in Cumbria, and a budget which hardly mentioned green inVestment are not the actions of a GoVernment sufficiently committed to climate action.In contrast, our local councils are deliVering at pace. I am proud of Lambeth and Southwark councils, which were among the first in the country to declare a climate emergency and are both making climate action a top priority.But they need additional resources and powers to make the scale of change that the climate emergency demands, including in relation to the planning system, where tackling the climate emergency must become a core aim.When I was first elected in 2015, I brought together organisations and INDIVIDUALS in my constituency who care about climate change and we formed an organisation called the Dulwich and West Norwood Climate Coalition.Ahead of COP26, we DELIVERED our letter to the Prime Minister signed by hundreds of local residents and community organisations. We called on him to secure the agreement we desperately need to tackle the climate emergency.My constituents across Dulwich and West Norwood understand the scale and the GRAVITY of the climate emergency.But this local action must be supported by the GoVernment through leadership on the international stage to secure the ambitious agreement necessary to secure the future of our planet for our children and grandchildren.",Copyright 2021 MSI Media Ltd All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|SLP|ENGLISH|National Edition|GLOBAL WARMINGNEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSAGREEMENTSCLIMATE CHANGEASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONSHEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENTGREEN ECONOMYTREATIES & AGREEMENTSPRIME MINISTERSREGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTSTALKS & MEETINGSCIVIC & SOCIAL ORGANIZATIONSCOMMUNITY ACTIVISMGREEN FINANCEGRANDCHILDREN|GLOBAL WARMINGGREEN ECONOMYGREEN FINANCEMINES & MINING|LONDON, ENGLAND|EARTHATLANTIC OCEANNORTH SEA|UNITED KINGDOM",

Kate Garraway 'so embarrassed' after double blunder on Good Morning Britain,"Good Morning Britain 's Kate Garraway  was left flustered on today's show (12 November) when her phone alarm repeatedly went off live on air.The presenter and her co-host Ben Shephard  had been looking through the morning's papers with politician Jacqui Smith  and broadcaster Iain Dale when her mobile phone erupted.Garraway was caught by surprise, and she attempted to turn the alarm off but was interrupted once again 10 minutes later as the group started to talk about COP26. As the alarm sounded for the second time, Garraway said: ""Oh for goodness sake, I'm really sorry. What the hell is going on? Oh my God.""Shephard called for the studio manager to take away the phone, and Garraway said: ""Shall we just remove it from the studio?""She added: ""How many alarms have I set? I'm blaming the kids, there was another one set for 6.45am.""Shephard joked: ""You really should be somewhere, Kate Garraway!""Garraway then confirmed she had switched off all of her alarms and said she was ""so embarrassed"".Earlier this year, Garraway released a documentary, Finding Derek , about her husband Derek Draper's hospitalisation for coronavirus.This Christmas, ITV will be releasing a follow-up film, Caring for Derek, that will look at the realities of life after bringing him home from the hospital.

There is still a lot more work to be done - time is running out,"" he warned.""As I speak my ministerial facilitators and negotiators are rolling up their sleeves and working hard to find solutions to some of the most intractable issues,"" Mr Sharma said.""I'll be holding meetings with all parties to find ways forward on matters specifically related to finance.""Negotiations on finance really need to accelerate and they need to accelerate now. We still have a monumental challenge ahead of us but collectively we have no choice but to rise to that challenge and strain every sinew to achieve a timely outcome.""Despite his warnings, however, Mr Sharma insisted that there was still time to make COP26 a success.He said a successful outcome would allow him to say ""with credibility"" that the 2015 Paris agreement goal of limiting global warming to as close to 1.5oC as possible had been ""kept within reach"".The draft deal currently being wrangled over by nations, if largely agreed, would enable him to say that, Mr Sharma said.The COP26 president said the pact announced by the US and China on Wednesday to accelerate action to cut emissions this decade and reduce methane leaks and de- forestation may also help other nations to put aside their differences.""I hope the spirit of co-operation in that agreement is also going to drive forward negotiations here at COP26,"" he said.A push for countries to come to the next COP meeting next year with fresh plans to cut carbon this decade is also meeting with resistance, from China in particular.Disagreements include a longstanding pledge by rich nations to pay poorer ones $100bn (£74.82bn) a year from 2020 to 2025 to help them deal with climate change.However, the target has not been met and will not until the end of next year at the earliest, the UK has admitted. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said an agreement in the closing hours of the summit to hit that target would go some way to smoothing the path for a broader consensus among the 197 nations involved in the discussions.""One relatively straightforward thing that should be done is delivering the $100bn a year finance. It would be shameful if we came out of this COP without meeting that commitment in full"".If, as widely expected, an agreement cannot be reached by tonight, the talks are likely to continue well into tomorrow - at which point there will be some kind of deal that may be significantly watered down from the draft proposals currently being debated.",Copyright 2021 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

According to the report, sustainability and transparency within the apparel industry have come under the spotlight in recent years due to rising external pressure from consumers and governments. The survey finds that two-thirds (66%) of apparel industry insiders see supply chain transparency as an ""extremely important"" issue. This number is even higher for Indian companies, at 83%.About 80% of the respondents aim to implement transparency solutions by 2027. However, less than 20% of the respondents have a comprehensive overview of all stakeholders in their supply chain (visibility) and 15% are able to trace all the materials and components used in a product from their origins through each step of processing and manufacturing (traceability). The study is into how the apparel industry is responding to calls for adoption of sustainable practices, and launches at a time when the importance of creating a more sustainable apparel industry has been underlined by talks held at the recent COP26 climate conference. The study draws on the findings of a global survey of over 200 senior executives in the apparel industry conducted in August 2021. Respondents represent brands, retailers, suppliers, manufacturers and sourcing agents of varying sizes. According to the report, three key factors are fuelling the need to uphold transparency.Corporate reputation: About 52% of suppliers and 59% of retailers/brands considered enhancing their corporate reputation as the main reason to boost their supply chain transparency.Business opportunities: Now more than ever, suppliers are motivated to improve supply chain transparency as part of their business goals, as this may allow them to tap into business opportunities with brands and retailers that are positioning themselves as sustainable or complying with stricter regulations.Profitability: Companies are looking to improve operational excellence to lower costs and preserve margins. Research indicates businesses with higher sustainability scores have a lower cost of capital. A sustainable apparel business can expect to have an average uplift in their net profit margin of 1-1.5% for brands and by 1.5-2.5% for suppliers.In a statement, Anson Bailey, Head of Consumer & Retail, ASPAC, KPMG China, said, ""Consumers nowadays have so much more information on the sustainability credentials of products, as well as the companies behind them and their impact on the wider community. The COP26 climate summit has also highlighted the need for the industry to change. Greater transparency means that brands will be held accountable, however it also opens up opportunities to better manage inventories, introduce more agility and achieve greater collaboration across the entire supply chain.""Currently, the capacity of the apparel industry to ensure supply chain transparency remains low. Challenges in achieving full transparency across supply chainsThe most prevalent barrier holding back the industry from achieving transparency is high initial investment. Difficulties in obtaining and managing data from other companies in the supply chain is another major obstacle. Still, two-thirds of industry respondents (65%) were willing to disclose their supply chain traceability policy. This proportion is much higher for suppliers in North America (80%) and Europe (81%). Suppliers in these regions are at a cost disadvantage to suppliers in Asia Pacific and may use their sustainability credentials to differentiate themselves from lower cost competition.Companies in India stand out in this regard, with 66% of the Indian respondents already disclosing their supply chain traceability policy.Against the backdrop of entrenched operating practices, low margins and the high degree of complexity in today's apparel supply chains, only 14% of companies surveyed have fully automated transparency systems in place for visibility and 13% for traceability. Meanwhile, over half of all the respondents still have manual processes in place for those two components - and the figure is higher for smaller and medium-sized businesses. With the increased demand for information from both consumers and regulators, there is an urgency for the industry to upgrade infrastructure. The adoption of digital technologies will be key to capturing material flows across the supply chain and for the entire network to gain visibility.In a statement, Vivek Ramachandran, Chief Executive Officer, Serai, said, ""Over 80% of the industry plans to have a transparency solution in place by 2027. However, businesses need to act with a greater sense of urgency. COP26 has reinforced the need for companies to find ways to reduce the environmental impact of their manufacturing. This can only be done through full visibility into their extended supply chains. Thankfully, the technology to help already exists. We've built a plug-and-play platform that integrates with existing solutions.""The report finds that investment in transparency tools will be crucial for apparel companies if they do not want to risk losing a competitive advantage. To move forward, the industry will need to overcome challenges associated with the consistency and quality of data. For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com",Copyright 2021 Bennett Coleman & Co. Ltd.

206,Appeal for migrant justice,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Evening Times (Glasgow),News,337,Pg. 11,337,Scotland,Stacey Mullen ,,,,Appeal for migrant justice,"AROUND 1000 campaigners took to the streets of the Southside yesterday, demanding justice for migrants.They set off from Kenmure Street in Pollokshields which was the site of a protest against the Home Office detention of two Indian nationals Sumit Sehdev and Lakhvir Singh in May.Activists marched to the Glasgow branch of the Home Office on Brand Street calling for an end to what they claim is the UK Government's hostile environment policy.The protest was organised by Migrants Organising for Rights and Empowerment (MORE), No Evictions and the Unity Centre and was held to coincide with COP26.Councillor Jon Molyneux was there to show his support. He said: ""I'm so pleased to see hundreds of people come together in Pollokshields this morning, to make clear that climate justice demands migrant justice.""A fitting way to mark six months since an incredible act of solidarity on Kenmure Street.""Yvonne is a representative of MORE. She said: ""We are here not by choice. My ancestors were taken and sold in slavery. We came here through our blood sweat and tears. We built this country. This country belongs to us and we will not hide.""The people who created the racist climate crisis are the same people who are sitting in the COP26 negotiations claiming to be solving it. But we have seen that COP26 is not about black lives matter. It is not about indigenous lives matter. It is just replicating the very same structures that got us here. Unless you speak about racial justice and migrant justice there cannot be climate justice.""The climate crisis is forcing millions of people off their ancestral lands by destroying agricultural land, driving drought, disease and extreme weather. The UK has a vast historical responsibility for driving this crisis yet instead of enabling people to escape its effects it is militarising borders and further criminalising migrants. ""If we want climate justice we must end detention, stop deportations, end the hostile environment, and create a world where migrants can live in dignity.""",Copyright 2021 Newsquest Media Group All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ETI|ENGLISH|NEGATIVE NEWSPROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONSENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICENEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSNEGATIVE MISC NEWSEVICTIONHUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONSRACE & ETHNICITYRACIAL JUSTICERACISM & XENOPHOBIASOCIAL JUSTICECLIMATE CHANGESLAVERYBLACK LIVES MATTERDEPORTATIONSEVERE WEATHERWEATHER|EVICTION|ABBY FINKENAUER|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|UNITED KINGDOM",
207,Blame game over climate,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,China Daily (Hong Kong Edition),News,1067,,1067,"Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China
China, People's Republic of",Shakeel Ahmad Ramay,,,,Blame game over climate,"The UN Climate Change Conference, or COP26, in Glasgow, United Kingdom, started with extreme hype and the slogan, ""it is last best hope"" to tackle climate change. People are looking toward the leaders; and how they can turn this hope into reality. However, the tune of the conference does not correspond with people's expectations. It is extremely shocking to note that leaders who delivered speeches at COP26 are not in the mood to act according to their status or responsibility. It seems they are only interested in delivering lectures and shifting the actions to someone else.The developed world is not ready to shoulder its historical responsibility, with some pushing poor and vulnerable countries to do more. They are offering peanuts in support to shift the burden and divert attention from their annual financing commitment of $100 billion, which they made many years ago.Simultaneously, the Western world, along with their partners and allies, are looking for scapegoats for their inaction and inability to act. They have made China a scapegoat, and Western media has launched a malicious campaign against the country. However, data analysis shows that China's per capita emissions have been far lower historically, compared to those of the developed world.United States President Joe Biden has forged a partnership with some countries to criticize China. Biden also unnecessarily criticized Chinese President Xi Jinping for not attending COP26. He tried to accuse China but refused to give any concrete timeline for the US to go for green development or reduction of greenhouse-gas, or GHG, emissions.Regardless, facts tell us a different story. Despite its minimum role in climate change, China is striving hard to contribute in the fight against global warming.First, the major transformation of the Chinese economy happened after the nation joined the World Trade Organization. When China joined the WTO in 2001, its GDP was only $1.3 trillion and the nation was in the 6th place globally. Besides, it is a well-established fact that climate change was a major concern well before 2000.Second, during the last forty years China substantially enhanced its forest areas. The total forest area of China was 12 percent in 1978, but it now stands at 23.4 percent. It means China added 11.4 percent to total forest area, equivalent to1.1 million square kilometers.Also, it has been pointed out that during the last two decades China's contribution to global greening is about 25 percent. It is pertinent to mention here that forests play a leading role in capturing carbon from the atmosphere. So, China is at the forefront to create a huge sink of carbon.Third, China has been busy establishing protected areas to conserve its biodiversity. President Xi has announced earlier that China has designated the Three-River-Source National Park, the Giant Panda National Park, the Northeast China Tiger and Leopard National Park, the Hainan Tropical Forests National Park, and the Wuyishan National Park, as its first batch of protected areas.Fourth, China is tirelessly working to reduce GHG emissions from different sources. China is leading the world to reduce energy intensity. During 2011-20, the nation reduced energy intensity by 28.7 percent per capita of GDP. The share of coal in the energy mix decreased from 72.4 percent in 2005 to 56.8 percent in 2020, and the contribution of non-fossil fuels is rising in the national energy mix.Besides, China, under the vision of eco-civilization and high-quality development, is transforming the whole economic, social and environment structure of the country. Eco-civilization is a core ingredient of all milestones, policies and visions. China has a special bond with the concept, as ancient Chinese philosophers, such as Confucius and Lao Tzu, were the first to talk about it.In modern times, Xi is championing the cause. Under his leadership, China has launched the 14th Five-Year plan and has committed to reduce carbon emission intensity by 18 percent till 2025. China will also be enhancing the role of Eco-Industrial Parks, focusing on resource efficiency, minimizing waste and championing green development.A Three-dimensional Transport Network is another major initiative by China to move toward the building of an ecological civilization. It has been designed to modernize and build a modern supply chain according to the principles of eco-civilization.Xi is also putting a lot of emphasis on the digital economy to reduce the nation's carbon footprint.The president is focusing on policies, legislation and tools to implement environment-friendly development plans. He believes that without strong policies and laws, the objectives of eco-friendly development cannot be achieved.In a nutshell, China has contributed more than its share, even though it does not have any historical burden or responsibility. Xi, meanwhile, is asking the world community to join hands to combat the challenge because he is convinced that the world is a community with a shared future.Despite all these efforts, China still faces criticism. It is interesting to note that the countries that are criticizing China are those that are the major polluters and are not doing enough. The real motive of the campaign is to contain China.China should not be bothered much by these campaigns and should keep working on its goal of eco-civilization and help other countries, especially the poor and less developed nations. The good thing is that China is already helping other countries through South-South cooperation.China has also expanded its green cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative to contribute to sustainable development goals. A special forum was launched under the name of Belt and Road Initiative International Green Development Coalition to facilitate a green transition through the BRI. So, it can be hoped that China will continue to play its role for a beautiful world and a community with a shared future.Meanwhile, China also needs help from friends to further accelerate its efforts for green development and a green planet. It is a huge task and China alone cannot complete the task. It needs support from friends to refute propaganda, so that it can concentrate on the real work.The author is CEO of the Asian Institute of Eco-civilization Research and Development in Pakistan.The views do not necessarily reflect those of China Daily.",Copyright 2021 China Daily Information.

The former industrial heartlands of Yorkshire and the North are most susceptible to decarbonisation because of their previous reliance on heavy industry for jobs.Yet, while the Government has acknowledged Yorshire’s potential as a world leader in green energy by providing significant support, this needs to be undertaken in tandem with the rejuvenation of all those communities that have been left behind – or which are struggling to forge a greener future.It’s why COP26 is a chance for joined-up government – provided, of course, that the PM is not unduly distracted by sleaze.",Copyright 2021 JPIMedia Publishing Ltd All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|AGREEMENTSHEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENTPRIME MINISTERSPUBLIC POLICYSCANDALSRENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRYREPORTS, REVIEWS & SECTIONSSUSTAINABILITYEDITORIALS & OPINIONS|RENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRYENERGY & UTILITIESPUBLISHING|BORIS JOHNSON|LONDON, ENGLAND|CHINAUNITED STATES",
209,Catriona Stewart: Don't allow car-obsessed nimbys to interfere with Glasgow's plans,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Herald Scotland,News,1066,,1066,Scotland,Catriona Stewart,,,,Catriona Stewart: Don't allow car-obsessed nimbys to interfere with Glasgow's plans,"IF there's one thing that gives honest citizens the collywobbles, it's talk of cutting car use.Yesterday, Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken announced that Glasgow city centre will become pedestrianised. A large section of the heart of Glasgow will be redesigned to make more space for people walking; to create safer routes for people wheeling and cycling; to cut congestion and lower carbon emissions; to make public transport faster and more efficient; and to create a welcoming, green city centre space.The main takeaway, though, was ""What?! But our cars!"" Yes, private vehicles will be removed - though provisions made for people with disabilities - but so much more will be added.Let's play a quick game. I'll call it ""Then or Now"".In response to changes to road changes, a reader of The Herald wrote thus in our letter's page: ""I am amazed and horrified at what is happening regarding traffic management throughout Glasgow."" Then or now? This was 2000.Another letter to the editor reflects on the impact of a new bus gate in the city centre. ""There will be a loss of a great number of jobs and subsequent reduction in the commercial rate income to Glasgow City Council."" Then or now? Again, 2000. Written by a business owner whose shop, 21 years later, is still there. As is the bus gate.Victoria Road, on Glasgow's South Side, has been undergoing multiple traffic transformations. ""Drivers, local businesses and motoring organisations condemned the moves as ill-conceived and poorly executed,"" was reported in this paper. Then or now? July 1997, in response to a new traffic system.The road is also, now, part of a \xC26.5 million cycle lane scheme called the South City Way, which has also been subjected to hearty nay-saying.Speaking of cycle lanes, a reader writes: ""Cycle lanes: Where is the mandate for this agenda? How much money has been spent on them throughout the city? Does the council seriously expect a significant number of people to start cycling to work?"" Then or now? Answer: June 2000.""See an integrated transport strategy? Not in Glasgow you won't!"" Then or now? Letter to The Herald from June 2000.''The Labour Administration both in Holyrood and Glasgow'' are ''addressing the need for a fully integrated transport system'."" The clue's there in the line - it's 2000. Change the administration and 21 years later we're still there.A letter writer with whom I cannot argue tells this paper: ""Instead of complaining that ''anti-car'' policies are unfair, we should all look at ourselves. Dare I suggest that many consider public transport to be for poor people, cycling for fitness freaks, and walking for recreation only?"" You'll have guessed - it's then. Or 1999, to be precise.What about this: ""We all know that cyclists, whether on path, road or common, have a sense of absolute entitlement to do whatever they want to do."" Then or now? This week, actually. Judge Alan Saggerson at Central London country court granting an appeal. Cheers guv.How about this one? ""I've only spoken to three people who back it - one doesn't drive a car and one is an environmentalist."" That's now, a Glasgow west end resident in response to new parking restrictions posed for north Kelvin and north Woodside where around 2000 residents have signed a petition against them.People feel penalised when they can't park outside their homes for free. In this instance the permits cost \xC285 for residential properties, which isn't a punitive sum when you\xE2ve probably paid upwards of \xC2300k for your home, and it's possible to buy visitor permits at \xC22 for four hours if you have friends come to visit.So, a nuisance but manageable.In all the above cases, the situation 20 years ago mimicked situations now. Reactions were similarly scornful, frustrated or outraged and yet the predicted falling of sky never occurred.Victoria Road is not dead. It suffered a decline that had very little to do with nearby streets becoming one-way and it is now undergoing a renaissance, despite a new bike lane and floating bus stops.People are well able to travel to work in the city centre, there is not increased congestion and yes, some of the one-way systems are a bit surprising, but don't we all navigate them smoothly now.The mass love affair with our cars continues because of another problem that has barely changed in the past two decades - a lack of a properly integrated public transport system.In London this week two British Airways and Virgin Atlantic aeroplanes took off simultaneously at Heathrow to mark the reopening of US borders to leisure travellers since Covid-19 closed borders in March 2020.On one hand, you appreciate their enthusiasm after an agonising 18 months apart for many friends and families, alongside the significant loss of trade for the industry; on the other hand it seemed a tone deaf clanger during COP26.Up the road in Glasgow, folk were just asking for a joined up local transport system. If a one-size-fits-all travel ticket can be magicked up for COP26 delegates then it can be sorted out after years of pleading by Greater Glasgow residents.If concerns still exist that not being able to drive to George Square will kill the city centre then maybe we need to look at the parking options at out of town malls.Do we start charging people for parking at car-centric shopping centres? We certainly have to make public transport more accessible. My mother lives an eight minute drive from Glasgow Fort but there's no way to get there by public transport.I live 20 minutes away by car at the other side of the city but there's a bus taking me directly there. That's nonsensical and won't be an isolated example, given our profit-before-people transport system.To get people out of their cars we have to offer them real alternatives that won't hugely inconvenience them. The absolutely frustrating thing is that this isn't in any way a new observation either.Two Jags John Prescott announced at COP26 this week he's given up his cars, sold all his Jaguars. I sense a swizz afoot here. The former deputy prime minister, famous for his gas-guzzling vehicle addiction, claims to be keen to cut his carbon emissions but, at the age of 83, he's perhaps decided to slow down as much as anything.Sort out public transport and make cycling safer and more attractive. It's so simple and yet will we still be here, in 2042, playing the same game?

210,"China, US climate deal sparks optimism in broader cooperation","November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Global Times (China),News,1354,,1354,"China, People's Republic of",GT staff reporters,,,,"China, US climate deal sparks optimism in broader cooperation","China US Photo:ICAhead of Friday's APEC leaders' summit which will see leaders from China and the US at the same virtual stage, the world's two biggest economies broke through their stalemate by reaching a climate action deal at the COP26, which Chinese analysts believe not only injected positive energy to global climate actions and success of COP26, but boosted confidence in future bilateral cooperation within the framework of APEC, and created a good atmosphere for the reported Xi-Biden virtual summit. Analysts said the US, after hitting the ceiling of its ""position of strength"" through months of pressure and attacks against China, finally realized the significance of bilateral cooperation. But they also warned that partisan politics and polarization in the US may affect the consistency of US pledges to cooperate, urging the US to be sincere, and keep its political tricks out of the constructive interactions of the two countries. But they also warned that partisan politics and polarization in the US may affect the consistency of US pledges to cooperate,Chinese President Xi Jinping will attend the 28th Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders' Meeting in Beijing by video link on Friday and deliver an important speech along with other world leaders, including US President Joe Biden. On Thursday, Xi attended the APEC CEO Summit through a prerecorded video and delivered a keynote speech, in which he stressed China's pledge to continue opening up and reach carbon neutrality. Highlighting China's commitment to advance reform and opening-up to add impetus to economic development in the Asia-Pacific, Xi said the country will continue to shorten the negative list on foreign investment, promote all-round opening-up of its agricultural and manufacturing sectors, expand the opening of the service sector, and treat domestic and foreign businesses as equals in accordance with law.A day before Xi's speech at the APEC CEO Summit, China and the US on Wednesday released the China-US Joint Glasgow Declaration on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s, which included setting up a working group and reducing methane and CO2 emissions. The two sides said they appreciated the work done so far and pledged to continue working together and with all parties to strengthen the implementation of the Paris Agreement. On the basis of the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, as well as taking into account national conditions, enhanced climate action will be taken to effectively address the climate crisis.The declaration is the product of candid exchanges, mutual understanding and efforts to expand consensus, which once again showed China and the US can work together on major international issues and accomplish great things that benefit the people of both countries and the world, Wang Wenbin, spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said at Thursday's media briefing. China is ready to work with the US to deepen dialogue and cooperation on climate change, inject positive energy to the multilateral process and promote a fair, win-win cooperation on the global climate system, Wang said. Xie Zhenhua, China's Special Envoy for Climate Change, said on the release of the declaration that it once again shows that China-US cooperation is the only right choice, and that China and the US have more consensus than differences on climate change.Yang Fuqiang, a research fellow at Peking University's Research Institute for Energy, told the Global Times the declaration could play a positive role not only for developed countries but also developing countries, with more cooperation in technologies such as reducing emissions of methane to be expected. Compared to the serious commitment made by the Chinese government in achieving the targets set by the Paris Agreement, there are many uncertainties in US politics, analysts said. For instance, if a Republican President is elected again, how can the US government guarantee they won't withdraw from the climate change commitment, given there has not been a strong public consensus in the US in support of climate actions compared to that of Europe? Yang noted. ""If the US government deviates from its commitment on climate change one more time, its credibility would be severely damaged,"" he said. However, China went steadily in accordance with the guidelines we have set no matter how the US reacted, Lü Xiang, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times. Some Western media said China did not make strong commitments at the COP26 and in the declaration with the US, but Lü said that China is not a bragging country but a down to earth one, and will not act like some Western countries which blindly make promises but don't honor them. Donald Trump's selfish and irresponsible withdrawal from the Paris agreement has set back global emissions cuts by about five years, and Biden needs to double his commitment to make up for the loss, and the US Congress must pass important measures to make long-term promises, analysts said. Positive sign?In some recent occasions, US officials tended to adopt a softer tone regarding China and tried to avoid using rhetoric carrying the connotation of confrontation, as they knew provocative words do nothing good for the US, Lü said. The latest remarks of US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, which claimed that the Biden administration is not seeking a fundamental transformation of the Chinese system in an interview with CNN this week, signaled a softer rhetoric of the Biden administration on bilateral relations. Analysts said that China and the US may strengthen cooperation in tackling the global pandemic, such as the fair distribution of vaccines to developing countries, as well as developing green and digital economy for global economy recovery at the APEC leaders' summit. The recent positive interactions show what Xi said that ""the Pacific Ocean is big enough to accommodate both China and the US.""In explaining the rhetorical change of the US, Ni Feng, deputy director of the Institute of American Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that China and the US have basically entered a phase of strategic balance in which no one can knock off the other, and this may last for quite a long time. However, some other Chinese analysts said we cannot be too optimistic in the US' positive stance to ease bilateral ties, given the partisan politics and polarization currently in the US.Six US Republican lawmakers just visited the island of Taiwan via a military aircraft on Tuesday and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday the US and its allies would take unspecified ""action"" if China were to use force to alter the status quo over Taiwan island. Analysts said during the strategic balance period, the US will create space for bilateral cooperation that favors the US, but won't hesitate to create trouble for China and the Taiwan question is the most obvious evidence. Ni warned that the US has been trying to escalate tensions on the Taiwan question, and the two countries may encounter an ""explosive scenario"" if they fail to properly control the situation, and the US may also make moves ideologically during the Democracy Summit in December to isolate China.The US claimed that it deals with China from ""the position of strength,"" and now its position of strength has hit the ceiling. In comparison, China is standing on an equal footing or even higher than the US in terms of a consistent and stable policy towards the US, Lü said. He said China and the US will embrace frequent interactions in the last two months of 2021 and first quarter of 2022, probably in trade and the military. ""A mutually satisfactory arrangement on bilateral trade is expected during the period, and the two militaries may carry out positive contacts on the South China Sea issue, as unlike the Taiwan question where the US uses military factors mainly for a political stance, military activities in the South China Sea may result in confrontation,"" Lü said. ",Copyright 2021 Global Times.

DRAFT DEAL FAILS TO DELIVER ON KEY TARGET, WORLD LEADERS WARNED Goal of 1.5C limit 'crucial to avoid floods, wildfires and heatwaves'","November 12, 2021 Friday",Non-jurisdictional,The Evening Standard (London),News,694,"NEWS;Pg. 1,9",694,,Nicholas Cecil:Rachael Burford:David Bond,,,,"COP SUMMIT: 1.5C IN 'MORTAL PERIL'? DRAFT DEAL FAILS TO DELIVER ON KEY TARGET, WORLD LEADERS WARNED Goal of 1.5C limit 'crucial to avoid floods, wildfires and heatwaves'","WORLD leaders were warned today that their latest COP26 draft deal leaves the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C in ""mortal peril"".Scientists say achieving this target is crucial to avoid the more catastrophic scenario of floods, fires and heatwaves from climate change. But a new draft agreement, published early this morning, failed to deliver any dramatic breakthrough on curbing harmful greenhouse gas emissions.Talks were still ongoing and there was a growing expectation that they could now run into tomorrow, after the planned end of COP26 today.Boris Johnson had set the ambition for the summit in Glasgow to ""keep alive"" the 1.5C goal, which in itself has been criticised as failing to address the urgency of the crisis.Shortly after the latest document was published, shadow business secretary Ed Miliband, who was a leading player in Britain's team at COP15 in Copenhagen in 2009, said: ""It's clear that the aim of this summit to keep 1.5 alive is in mortal peril."" The changes include: ? Rather than calling for countries ""to accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels"", it now urges them to accelerate the shift toContinued on Page 9 climate summitContinued from Page 1 clean energy systems by ""accelerating the phase out of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels"".. ? Countries are now ""requested"" rather than ""urged"" to ""revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets"" in their national action plans by the end of 2022 to align with global goals to limit temperature rises to ""well below"" 2C and try to limit them to 1.5C.Michael Jacobs, a former climate adviser to Gordon Brown, said: ""I see this as a strengthening of the language which effectively means countries are being told to come back next year with nationally determined contributions aligned to the 1.5C temperature goal."" But Greenpeace International executive director Jennifer Morgan disagreed, saying: ""It's even weaker now.""."" ? A pledge that richer nations will give the poorest countries $100 billion (£73 billion) a year, which should have happened by now, to help them tackle climate change and make their industries greener also appears to have been watered down. The latest version is better ""balanced"" towards recognising the climate change threats facing developing countries. A new qualifying clause to the section on updating 2030 targets includes that this ""requested"" action ""takes into account different national circumstances"".Asked if the draft meets or falls short of his hopes for Glasgow, climate expert Lord Stern said: ""It falls short of what one would hope for in the sense of really driving to 1.5C and tackling clean development. But I think it goes beyond where I thought it might be a few days ago when we saw the one before.""The peer, who led the 2006 Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, added: ""I think this new text is stronger, has a greater sense of urgency, looking at all forms of finance, and the importance of getting it in place next year, when we have to both deliver on the $100 billion and put in place something which is much bigger and better.""Dr Thomas Hale, associate Professor in Public Policy at Oxford's Blavatnik School of Government, added: ""If you look at the whole package we have seen some progress towards limiting emissions. But we need to see much more next year (at the next COP in Egypt) in order to keep 1.5C alive.""Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon said she would not ""bet lots of money"" on the talks being completed by the 6pm deadline. She told the BBC the agreement was in ""many respects slightly better than the draft that was published earlier in the week, but it still has a way to go"".? Climate activists have deflated the tyres of ""gas-guzzling luxury cars"" parked on city streets as part of action to raise awareness about carbon emissions.Activist group Tyred of SUVs said they deflated the wheels of around 60 4x4s in Glasgow's west end as COP26 takes place in the city. They also placed ""climate violation"" tickets on the windscreens, which stated: ""Your SUV contributes to the second biggest cause of carbon emissions rises in the last decade.""",Copyright 2021 Evening Standard Limited All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|EST|ENGLISH|HEAT WAVESCLIMATOLOGYENERGY & UTILITIESEXTREME TEMPERATURESGLOBAL WARMINGCLIMATE CHANGEENERGY & ENVIRONMENTEMISSIONSGREENHOUSE GASESFIRESSCIENCE & TECHNOLOGYEARTH & ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCEWILDFIRESCOAL FIRED PLANTSEXECUTIVESAGREEMENTSNATURAL DISASTERSDEVELOPING COUNTRIESALTERNATIVE & RENEWABLE ENERGY|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|BORIS JOHNSONED MILIBANDGORDON BROWN|National Edition",
216,Councils will be at the forefront of efforts to reach green targets,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,thetimes.co.uk,News,574,NEWS;Version:1,574,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,James Jamieson,,,,Councils will be at the forefront of efforts to reach green targets,"Over the past two weeks we have seen world leaders set out their commitment to tackle the climate emergency, with a headline-grabbing mix of ambitious targets and multibillion global funding announcements.Countries have signed up to reduce emissions, to safeguard forests and to tackle methane. For councils, this will be an invaluable opportunity to share learning and experience with our counterparts around the world.Beyond the promises and pledges from the international stage of Cop26, it will be local governments in cities, towns and rural areas across the world that will be mobilising and driving the collective action required to address climate change.Only local government holds the wide range of powers and tools to decarbonise transport, buildings, waste, energy, nature and growth.This is why the Local Government Association has been leading calls for a dedicated local and regional government day, which took place as the Cities, Regions and the Built Environment Day, during the final important international negotiations.As it stands, the draft Cop26 agreement text does not include reference to the essential role of local government around the world in responding to climate change: this needs to change.Councils are a unique and powerful partner in achieving net zero, able to impact on more than a third of all emissions from villages, towns and cities, such as through housing, transport and the natural environment.But the influence councils can have on reducing carbon emissions has been underused.At Cop26 we are setting out the case for why councils are best-placed to deliver green infrastructure projects in local communities. As our new polling has found, more people trust councils to tackle climate change in their local area than government or world leaders.We are calling on the government to use the summit to deepen the climate change partnership between central and local government with a new approach focused on delivery that gives councils the long-term funding to decarbonise building stock, reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transport and deliver clean energy projects, and more.For example, with the right investment and support, councils stand ready to embark on an ambitious programme of retrofitting more than 1,000 homes a day with low-carbon efficiency measures by 2030, reducing energy bills by nearly £700 million a year.This would mean warmer and more comfortable homes and buildings saving the NHS £1.9 billion a year, and supporting almost 31,000 new, skilled jobs in the construction and retrofitting industries.Long before Glasgow, councils up and down the country have declared a climate emergency and have been taking local action in a variety of exciting ways to achieve net zero.In Leeds we have seen half of organisations taking part in an electric vehicle trial scheme tell the council they are now considering switching to zero emission vehicles. North Somerset has plans to rewild as much land as possible, creating new habitats enabling wildlife to thrive.In York the council is delivering a newbuild housing programme with all homes built to achieve zero carbon in use. The first homes will be complete next year.It is the action taken in the places where people live and businesses do their business that will determine how successful we are in tackling the climate emergency.

It prevents the worst - a US-China decoupling on climate action,"" he said.Kelly Sims Gallagher, director of the climate policy lab at Tufts University's Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in the US, said the announcement was ­""indeed important and the significance is that it happened at all"".""The fact the two countries could find a way to release a joint statement at a time when the ­bilateral relationship is so strained sends an energising ­signal to the COP26 negotiators because it demonstrates that these two major emitters can still work together,"" she said.Officials from both nations raised the prospect of further ­cooperation, with US climate envoy John Kerry comparing it to talks between the US and Soviet Union on scaling down their ­nuclear arsenals during the ­Cold War.His counterpart Xie Zhenhua said there was more agreement than divergence on climate change between the two sides.""The release of the joint declaration once again proved that ­cooperation between China and the US was the only correct choice and by working together, the two countries can achieve many important things that are beneficial not only to the two countries but the world as well,"" Xie said.But the joint statement omitted one key point - strengthening 2030 emissions reduction targets to keep alive the Paris ­Agreement's goal of limiting ­global temperature rises to less than 2 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels and trying to keep this down to 1.5C.COP26's draft declaration urges countries to strengthen their 2030 targets by the end of next year, but the US-China ­declaration just commits them to ­taking action to keep the Paris Agreement target within reach ""including as necessary communicating or updating 2030 NDCs [nationally determined contributions] and long-term strategies"".Some observers said the joint statement - which helped pave the way for further cooperation ahead of a virtual summit ­between presidents Xi ­Jinping and Joe Biden - was a small ­concession and ­confrontation would continue.Shi Yinhong, an international relations professor at Renmin University, said that since Biden took office in January, the US stance had been ""very clear"" in urging China to increase its ­climate ambitions.""Now maybe partly because of the virtual meeting between Xi and Biden, the confrontation ­between the two countries on ­climate change has partly and slightly eased, but in essence, ­conflicts obviously exist and will persist,"" he said.Greenpeace's Li warned that ongoing confrontation between the two countries would undermine the global momentum on fighting climate change.""The main challenges for the two countries' climate negotiations are bilateral relations and their domestic politics,"" he said.""Especially in the US, there is still uncertainty about to what extent Congress will approve the president's climate actions.""The world should know, with the current state of geopolitics, banking on the US and China is not enough.

As two major powers in the world, China and the US shoulder special international responsibilities and obligations.""We need to think big and feel responsible. We need to work ... hard to promote world peace and development. We need to actively address climate change through cooperation, bringing benefits to both our two peoples and peoples around the world.""The announcement appeared to take summit host nation Britain by surprise, given Prime Minister Boris Johnson had only hours earlier warned momentum at the talks was slowing.The Glasgow declaration was released just a week after US President Joe Biden attacked Chinese President Xi Jinping for not attending the summit in person, describing it as a ""big mistake"".""The rest of the world is going to look to China and say, 'what value added are they providing?',"" Biden said last week. ""They've lost the ability to influence the people around the world and all the people here at COP.""The document promises the US and China will work together on emissions reductions and an accelerated phase-out of unabated coal, however timelines were not listed.The statement also binds China to tackle damaging methane emissions and deforestation, while both countries have agreed to share technology and expertise on clean energy, decarbonisation and electrification.Crucially, the statement notes both countries are committed to the Paris Agreement goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5 degrees and conceded there was a ""gap"" between current policies and meeting that core target.Kerry, a former US secretary of state under Barack Obama, framed the surprise agreement as much-needed momentum for the COP26 talks. ""The two largest economies in the world have agreed to work together to raise climate ambition in this decisive decade,"" Kerry told reporters in Glasgow.He said the joint-declaration was a ""road map for our present and future collaboration"" on climate change. ""It declares specifically and identifies the need to accelerate the transition to a global net-zero economy,"" Kerry said.""Secondly, it commits to a series of important actions, not out in the long term but now, in this decade where it's needed. What President Biden wanted to do, and President Xi agreed we should do, is join together to work at trying to solve this. And I am convinced that's a better road to pursue.""Xie and Kerry noted that the US had developed a plan to reduce methane emissions and said China would follow suit.""Climate change is a common challenge faced by humanity. It bears on the wellbeing of future generations,"" Xie said.Laurence Tubiana, a key architect of the Paris Agreement and head of the European Climate Foundation, said the joint declaration proved co-operation on climate was possible.

219,Fighting climate change on the homes front,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Herald (Glasgow),News,487,Pg. 19,487,Scotland,Drew Allan ,,,,Fighting climate change on the homes front,"COP26 has been described as ""the last best hope for the world to get its act together"" on climate change, and the science could not be clearer. Climate change is happening in every part of the world, with the most vulnerable people being the worst affected.The current commitments to cut emissions are nowhere near enough. Since the Paris Agreement of 2015, obstacles and diversions have been put in the way. Political leaders have failed to prioritise a safe climate and liveable planet, and we have lost valuable time.We still have a society that is based on consumption, causing damage to our planet and creating unjust and unfair use of resources. We need to move to a fairer, more equitable society where collaboration and community are the priority, and we need a sustainable finance sector to play a leading role in this.Making our homes energy efficient and good for our health is central to this transition. We have millions of homes across the United Kingdom that are costly to heat. Indeed, heating our homes produces 15 per cent of carbon emissions. We urgently need retrofit at a national scale to ensure our homes are properly insulated, ventilated and equipped with low-carbon heating. Without this, heating bills will spiral. We must also ensure that newbuild homes are fit for the future, built to high standards of energy efficiency so they will not need further upgrades. For the financial sector supporting that development, we need nothing short of a revolution, where community and society come first and mutual benefit is enshrined into lending and borrowing. The prime focus when Ecology Building Society started life more than 40 years ago was to engender change by encouraging projects that avoid harmful environmental impact. We now realise that, more than ever, we need to go further and help bring about a systemic change in banking.At COP26 and beyond we have been focusing on two main outcomes: mobilising finance to urgently fund the transition to a low-carbon economy; and decarbonising the built environment by retrofitting existing homes and helping build new homes with low embodied carbon. Scotland, in fact, is our biggest area of sustainable lending. We have helped support groundbreaking projects such as Scotland's first community-owned Passivhaus homes in Dumfries and Galloway and affordable, modular built eco-homes for the Mull and Iona Community Trust. On the Isle of Mull we're helping to create homes for long-term rent for those in housing need and the high levels of energy efficiency means they will be more affordable in the long term.As COP26 continues, much of the focus has been on global level policymaking. However, there is more to be done at the smallest unit of society: the home. It is important to do everything we can to leverage the power of the financial community for the good of our homes and society.Paul Ellis is chief executive of Ecology Building Society",Copyright 2021 Newsquest Media Group All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|HER|ENGLISH|agriculture|CLIMATE CHANGECLIMATOLOGYEMISSIONSENERGY EFFICIENCY & CONSERVATIONENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMSSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTAGREEMENTSECOLOGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCEENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCESENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCHGREEN ECONOMYGREEN FINANCENEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSPOLLUTION & ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTSLOW CARBON ECONOMYENERGY & ENVIRONMENTGREEN BUILDINGGREENHOUSE GASES|EMISSIONSENERGY EFFICIENCY & CONSERVATIONENERGY & UTILITIESBANKING & FINANCEENERGY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMSSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTGREEN ECONOMYGREEN FINANCEREAL ESTATELOW CARBON ECONOMYCOMMUNITY BANKSENERGY & ENVIRONMENTFRIENDLY & PROVIDENT SOCIETIESGREEN BUILDINGMEDIA & TELECOMMUNICATIONSSAVINGS & LOANS|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|EARTH|SCOTLANDUNITED KINGDOM",

222,Governments have only offered a hotchpotch of measures on climate change',"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Dorset Echo,News,385,,385,England & Wales,Joanna Davis,,,,Governments have only offered a hotchpotch of measures on climate change',"We are unable to halt the process of Climate Change because governments have failed to adopt a cohesive plan of action at COP26.They have offered us only a \xE2hotchpotch\xE2 of unconnected measures without the \xE2framework\xE2 of an international plan of action to hold everything together.Ironically, their pathetically small offerings appeal more to the major polluters of our planet, the coal, oil and gas barons.Their profits are rising inexorably as their fossil fuels \xE2of every colour except green\xE2 destroy Earth\xE2s species.George Monbiot made the point in the Guardian of 20th October that we are avoiding the challenge of treating Climate Change as importantly as if we are \xE2going to war\xE2.For example, our actions so far have been infinitesimal compared with the sacrifice, determination and commitment we were prepared to invest in defeating Hitler. The following day the Guardian reported that nations with huge reserves of fossil fuels were already displaying a lack of interest in COP26. It\xE2s not hard to see why; they want to protect the sources of energy which have made them rich. Coal, oil and natural gas were once essential to our growth and prosperity but now threaten our very existence.Companies and countries with huge quantities of indigenous fossil fuels are treating global warming as just another opportunity to make money.Already, they are putting forward ideas of how to produce \xE2blue hydrogen\xE2 using stocks of \xE2dirty\xE2 fossil fuels when green sustainable hydrogen can easily be produced from sunlight. My dread is that our politicians will continue deferring to the greed of carbon dioxide-emitting industries. Inviting their representatives to the COP26 conference is rather like \xE2giving arsonists boxes of matches to play with in a wooden house\xE2. It would be wiser to treat them as our enemies.For a mere 1.3% of the cost of the average house, we could fit every one of our roofs facing South, East or West with self-financing solar panels.Why not include schools, office blocks, factories, supermarkets and stations too? Let's get serious and make a difference. Currently, all we can hear are mutual condolences.This conference was a marvellous opportunity for us to take the lead.

225,Inside Politics: Anger as ministers use rent expense loophole to cash in while letting own homes,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),News,1440,INDEPENDENT PREMIUM;Version:1,1440,England & Wales,Matt Mathers,,FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP,FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP,Inside Politics: Anger as ministers use rent expense loophole to cash in while letting own homes,"""We have started a fire and we have no idea how to put the fire out."" Those were the now prophetic words of Nigel Mills, one of the rebel Tory MPs who last week stood his ground and refused to back No 10's attempt to rip up sleaze rules to save Owen Paterson from suspension. More than a week on from the vote and Paterson's resignation, there is plenty of scorched earth to survey while the blaze still shows no signs of dying out. Mills himself probably did not anticipate just how furious the backlash would be and there are more than just a few Tory MPs wishing they followed his example, rather than their boss down into the trenches - or the sewers, as the opposition parties have become fond of saying. Friday's papers and news websites are brimming with yet more allegations of sleaze, with a renewed focus on MPs' renting of second homes. According to analysis by The Independent 17 MPs - five ministers and Sir Geoffrey Cox among them - have picked £1.3m in rent expenses from the pocket of the taxpayer  while letting out properties that they own in London. This morning's Times splashes on a similar story while the Financial Times has on its front page a story saying Boris Johnson has raked in some £4m since entering the House of Commons. Looks like it's going to be another less than straightforward weekend for Downing Street. Elsewhere, it's the final day of the Cop26 summit in Glasgow and Lord Frost is holding further Brexit talks with the EU.                     Inside the bubble                   Parliament not sitting                     Coming up:                   - Scotland first minister Nicola Sturgeon on BBC Breakfast at 8.20am- Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband on BBC Radio 4 Today at 8.40am                     Daily Briefing                                        COINING IT: International trade secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan, defence secretary Ben Wallace, Foreign Office minister James Cleverly, prisons minister Victoria Atkins and junior Treasury minister John Glen are the government ministers using a rent expenses loophole to line their pockets. There are a few ex-ministers and two Labour MPs - Geraint Davies and Clive Betts - who also make the unsavoury list. All the MPs have put their housing costs on expenses while earning more than £10,000 a year each renting out their own properties in recent years. This week's revelations have heaped further pressure on the PM, who has come under fire from angry MPs on the government benches - and those who sat there before them. As a new poll showed that Labour had taken the lead over the Conservatives, former cabinet minister and party grandee Malcolm Rifkind warned Johnson that he is in danger of becoming ""a liability"" to his party  and of being toppled by his own MPs as Margaret Thatcher was. The former foreign secretary told The Independent there is a growing mood that the PM is failing to show proper leadership. ""I was in the cabinet when Margaret Thatcher was required to fall on her sword. And if somebody of the stature of Thatcher can be disposed of pretty quickly and pretty ruthlessly by the parliamentary party, no prime minister can assume that they're free from that risk.""                     'COMPLETELY UNTRUE': Keir Starmer has not escaped scrutiny over work he's done in the past and last night denied a claim by Jeremy Corbyn's team that it was the former leader who blocked his plans for a second job with a law firm. While in the shadow cabinet, Starmer said he had been ""in talks"" about working for Mishcon de Reya in 2017 but never followed through on taking up work for the firm. ""Corbyn stopped Starmer taking a second job doing high-paid consultancy work for law firm Mishcon de Reya in 2017, several key figures from the Corbyn leadership have confirmed to me,"" Corbyn's former speech writer and biographer Alex Nunns tweeted . ""The matter was raised at a meeting of the shadow cabinet, where 'Jeremy very politely reminded Keir what Labour Party policy was', according to a senior member of Corbyn's shadow ministerial team."" But the claim was described as ""entirely untrue"" by Starmer's spokesperson, who declined to say why the job was not taken up. ""Keir had rejected the offer from Mishcon de Reya before the then leader's office was even aware of it"". Starmer has declared more than £25,000 for legal work carried out before he became Labour leader, including almost £10,000 for advising the government of Gibraltar, widely seen as a tax haven.                     10 SECONDS TO MIDNIGHT: Cop26 enters its final day on life support with UK president Alok Sharma warning yesterday that securing a deal to keep 1.5C alive will be ""monumental challenge"". Officials are still hopeful that an agreed text will be produced by the scheduled end of the summit on Friday afternoon, though many delegates think that the summit will spill over into the weekend as wrangling intensifies on crucial details. ""Whilst we have made progress, we are not there yet on the most crucial issues,"" Sharma said. ""There is still a lot more work to be done and Cop26 is scheduled to close at the end of tomorrow. Time is running out."" Sharma's comments came after the UK declined to join an international alliance  aiming to end new oil and gas projects, leaving a small group of other countries led by Costa Rica and Denmark to forge a path away from fossil fuels.                     LONDON CALLING: The latest round of talks with the EU to rehash the UK's post-Brexit trade arrangements for Northern Ireland are due to begin in London. Britain's chief negotiator to the EU, Lord Frost, is to meet European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic later. An agreement is still some way off and both sides have been issuing threats  on trade sanctions, although the rhetoric used has died down somewhat.                     JOBS FOR THE BOYS: An ex-Conservative advisor who is married to a Tory MP will help choose the UK's next media regulator, the government has confirmed.  Michael Simmonds, husband of former schools minister Nick Gibb and brother-in-law of former No 10 communications chief Robbie Gibb, will sit on the interview panel who will choose the next chair of Ofcom. Downing Street is widely reported to want former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre to take the job and has already re-booted the recruitment process once after the right-winger unexpectedly failed his final interview and was deemed ""not appointable"".                     On the record                   ""The big incidents of the week, and a number of smaller ones as well, suggest that old habits die hard. The events of the last week have been intensely damaging. I'm not in the House of Commons, but it would appear he's in danger of becoming seen as a liability rather than an asset. And the Conservative Party has a reputation, a well-deserved reputation, of being ruthless when prime ministers are deemed to have outlived their usefulness.""

226,Ireland makes COP pledge to end gas and oil,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Irish Daily Mail,News,730,NEWS;Pg. 4,730,Ireland,James Ward,,,,Ireland makes COP pledge to end gas and oil,"IRELAND has joined an alliance of countries that has pledged to phase out the production of oil and gas to tackle climate change at the COP26 summit in Glasgow.Denmark, Costa Rica, France, Wales, Sweden, Greenland and the Canadian province of Quebec are also core members of the alliance, which has committed to end new licensing for oil and gas exploration and set an end date for their exploration, with globally agreed goals to limit dangerous warming.Commenting on the significant move yesterday, Climate Minister Eamon Ryan said: 'Ireland is leading the way in incentivising the transition to renewable energy and putting ourselves on a pathway to net zero, by legislating to keep fossil fuels in the ground. The decision we have made today sends a powerful message we are moving irrevocably away from fossil fuels towards a renewable future - both in Ireland and internationally.'Mr Ryan added: 'Through the Climate Act 2021, Ireland has closed the door on new exploration activities for oil and gas. There is no longer a legal basis for granting new licences.'In line with Government policy of keeping fossil fuels in the ground, Ireland is 'also legislating to prohibit exploration for and extraction of coal, lignite and oil shale', the minister also confirmed.Meanwhile, Taoiseach Micheál Martin has hailed a pact made by the US and China at the COP26 climate summit.The two superpowers, who are the world's biggest emitters of CO2, pledged to act in a joint declaration made in a surprise announcement in Glasgow on Wednesday.Both nations agreed to 'recall their firm commitment to work together' and to close the 'significant gap' to achieving the 1.5C temperature goal set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement.Yesterday, Mr Martin praised US president Joe Biden for bringing America back from the point of being in 'climate denial' under the Trump administration.He said: 'The most important thing that happened in the last year and a bit has been the election of Joe Biden as president of the US in respect of climate change.'That's my view because prior to that we were facing a fairly depressing scenario where you had an administration that was almost in climate denial.'Why is that important? You can see already leading into COP26 that the European Union, which is a leader in terms of climate change, is now partnering with the US and the Biden administration with John Kerry as a special envoy, and driving the global agenda.'Now this morning, we hear about a very good partnership announcement between the US and China.'Mr Martin also said that 'John Kerry's saying he's had 30 meetings with his counterpart in China'.The Taoiseach continued: 'They're reaching agreement. The Chinese envoy on climate is now saying this is an existential crisis, we're partnering with the world and with the US to deal with this. This is progress.' Mr Martin also said Ireland has much to do on the climate change front.'Speed is everything here and we in this country are behind,' he told Dermot and Dave on Today FM.'We need to move, because it's about the generations, it's about my children, the children coming after me. That's what this is about.' The Taoiseach said it was important not to 'vilify' certain sectors on the issue, but instead work together to find solutions.He referenced a meeting with 15-year-old climate activist and farmer Liadh Dalton, from Belmont, Co. Offaly, who spent a day working in the Taoiseach's office this week as part of a Unicef programme.Mr Martin said: 'Her main concern, she's a young farmer from Offaly, is very committed to climate change, but feels that we're not building bridges between communities. That rather than vilifying, say, the agricultural community, we should be engaging and building bridges with the agricultural community; working out projects through research as to what will help them reduce methane, get better practices, technologies. And it was very interesting.'Mr Martin also said that he thought 'it was a good insight for me'. He added: 'Here's a young person whose future is at stake, who loves the land, is on the land for generations and wants to be a part of the solution.'And she is saying to me: ""Look, stop attacking our community on a constant basis. Work with us to get it done.""'That has to be the spirit that informs how we approach this into the future.'news@dailymail.ie'It was a good insight for me'",Copyright 2021 Irish Daily Mail - Associated Newspapers Ltd All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|DML|ENGLISH|Ireland|CLIMATE CHANGEAGREEMENTSALLIANCES & PARTNERSHIPSUS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020EUROPEAN UNIONCLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION & POLICYOIL & GAS INCENTIVESTALKS & MEETINGSGOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONRENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRYPUBLIC POLICYHEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS|ENERGY & UTILITIESOIL & GAS INDUSTRYOIL & GAS EXPLORATIONOIL & GAS INCENTIVESOIL EXPLORATIONPROSPECTING & EXPLORATIONRENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRYALTERNATIVE & RENEWABLE ENERGY|JOE BIDENMICHEAL MARTINDONALD TRUMP|PARIS, FRANCEGLASGOW, SCOTLAND|QUEBEC, CANADA|UNITED STATESIRELANDCHINACANADADENMARKEUROPEFRANCEGREENLANDEUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES",

We saw in London the consequences of flash flooding in summer, the Tube being closed down and homes being flooded. We saw the floods in New York, Germany and wildfires in Greece. I'm hoping in the last few hours everyone redoubles their efforts.""His comments come as UK minister and Cop president Alok Sharma warned that negotiators still face a ""monumental challenge"" in reaching consensus on key issues before the summit's scheduled finish time today.""Whilst we have made progress, we are not there yet on the most crucial issues,"" he said. ""Time is running out.""How to include the need to drastically move away from fossil fuels in the final Glasgow text is reported to be a key sticking point for countries hammering out a deal.Yesterday, a small group of countries led by Denmark and Costa Rica announced that they would forge a path to ending new oil and gas production, a step scientists say will be crucial to meeting global climate goals.However, the UK government, which is hosting the Glasgow summit, said it would not join the international alliance aimed at moving away from fossil fuels.Mr Khan said that the UK's decision to snub the agreement showed a lack of leadership. ""We should be leading by example,"" he said. The mayor yesterday attended a meeting with UN chief Antonio Guterres and other city leaders to mark ""cities day"" at Cop26.Last week, he was elected the new chair of C40 cities, a group of 97 city mayors from across the world aiming to take action on the climate crisis. He said that he believed cities could take the lead on tackling the climate crisis where national governments had fallen behind.""More than two-thirds of the C40 cities are either on course to meet the promises made at Paris or have exceeded that,"" he said. ""That's versus the only country I could find that's meeting the Paris Agreement and that's the Gambia.""He added that he was still hopeful that nations could make positive progress to address the climate crisis at Cop26.""The key thing that needs to come out of this Cop is optimism,"" he said. ""If pessimism or defeat comes out of this, that doesn't bode well for national governments or for the sectors, businesses or mayors. That's why it's so important for there to be momentum.""",Copyright 2021 Independent Print Ltd All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|IA|ENGLISH|News|AGREEMENTSCITY GOVERNMENTCLIMATE CHANGECLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION & POLICYMAYORSPUBLIC OFFICIALSTALKS & MEETINGSGOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONNEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSCITIESFLOODS & FLOODINGCITY LIFESCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY|ENERGY & UTILITIESOIL & GAS INDUSTRY|SADIQ KHANANTONIO GUTERRES|LONDON, ENGLANDGLASGOW, SCOTLAND|NEW YORK, USA|UNITED KINGDOMGAMBIAGERMANY",
228,Letter from the editor,"November 12, 2021 Friday",U.S. Federal,University Wire,News,439,NEWS;Pg. 1,439,,Lucie Lagodich,,,,Letter from the editor,"To the Lafayette Community,Greetings from Glasgow, Scotland! I am writing from the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26). As a result, the editing of this week's edition is a bit unconventional, with me editing remotely from my room in the West End.I am here representing The Lafayette at The New York Times Climate Hub and attending the Green Zone at the COP26 summit. The Climate Hub is a week of panels, talks, workshops and even a fashion show, all relating to sustainable themes. I hope my appearance at this conference is the first of many students who will have this opportunity in the coming years, and that my attendance represents the shifting tide on our campus that we have seen during my time here, spurred forward by the Climate Action Plan 2.0 (CAP 2.0), passed my freshman year.I hope Lafayette continues to not only push for sustainable initiatives but prioritizes them. The big message of COP26 is that climate change is here. As an institution, Lafayette has the capability of making a large-scale difference by cutting carbon emissions. I applaud the work our school has already achieved. We are installing solar panels, building more energy-efficient buildings, replacing lightbulbs, creating a sustainable food loop with fresh produce from LaFarm and more. The CAP 2.0 consists of plans like these and more, with the ambitious goal (which Lafayette remains on track for) of hitting net zero carbon emissions by 2035.I agree that all steps towards a sustainable campus are vital, but I am concerned that nearly half of our carbon emissions that we need to cut in order to reach net-zero have been written off in a solar power purchase agreement Lafayette has signed onto with Lehigh University, Muhlenberg College and Dickinson College. This agreement negates 100% of Lafayette's emissions associated with electricity consumption. Located in West Texas, this exists as an offset, with none of the power generated reaching College Hill.Forbes, The Guardian and even the United Nations released a report stating that net-zero is not enough to save our planet. I marched for climate justice with over 100,000 people in the streets of Glasgow on Nov. 6, and the headlining photo for the press coverage of the event is a huge banner, featuring the words ""net zero"" crossed out. Many countries, companies and institutions are setting these net zero goals-which is a great first step-but I hope Lafayette goes beyond the 15-year power purchase agreement cutting 47% of our emissions and commits to larger goals to reduce on-campus carbon emissions beyond the 53% needed for carbon neutrality.Lucie Lagodich",Copyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|Easton|PA|CLIMATE CHANGECONFERENCES & CONVENTIONSAGREEMENTSEMISSIONSGREENHOUSE GASESUNITED NATIONSSTUDENTS & STUDENT LIFESUSTAINABILITYENERGY EFFICIENCY & CONSERVATIONGREEN BUILDINGENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICECARBON OFFSETSSOLAR POWER INDUSTRYSUSTAINABLE PRODUCTSFASHION SHOWS|EMISSIONSENERGY & UTILITIESENERGY EFFICIENCY & CONSERVATIONGREEN BUILDINGCARBON OFFSETSSOLAR ENERGYSOLAR POWER INDUSTRYSUSTAINABLE PRODUCTSENERGY CONSUMPTIONFASHION SHOWS|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|EARTHTEXAS, USA|SCOTLAND",

United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland",Tess de la Mare,,IPSOS MORI,IPSOS MORI,Only a fif th think answer will be found by politicians,"ALMOST half of Britons are following the Cop26 climate talks in Glasgow, but only 20 per cent trust politicians to deliver an agreement to stave off runaway global warming, polling has found.Some 46 per cent of Britons have been following the summit, with about one in ten saying they are following it closely.The UK public had the most faith in experts to ensure the negotiations reach a viable agreement, with four in ten saying scientists were best placed to achieve this, according to research by Ipsos Mori.As the talks enter their final phase, fewer than one in five think politicians will get the job done, with only 17 per cent saying they trust UK policy makers, and 14 per cent having faith in those from other countries.Out of a sample of 1,016 adults aged 16 to 75, more had faith in climate activists than politicians, with 24 per cent saying they could successfully force an agreement over the line.Some 15 per cent of respondents said none of the delegates would be able to make the talks a success, with 6 per cent saying they did not think an agreement should be reached.China and India were perceived as dragging their feet - with around 50 per cent of those polled saying they could be doing more.Half of Britons said the commitment from prime minister Narendra Modi for India to be carbon neutral by 2070 was not ambitious enough, while 48 per cent said the same of China's pledge to be carbon neutral by 2060.The pledge by more than 100 countries to end deforestation by 2030 which was announced early on in the conference was the most popular, with 41 per cent saying the target was about right. Nearly a third - 29 per cent - say it is not ambitious enough while only 17 per cent say it is too ambitious.The commitment to cut methane emissions by 30 per cent by 2030 from over 100 nations divided opinion - 33 per cent said it was not ambitious enough, 34 per cent said it was about right and two in ten thought it too ambitious.Rachel Brisley, head of energy and environment at Ipsos Mori Public Affairs, said: 'Public confidence in politicians to strike a deal is not high.'A YouGov poll published this week revealed public concern for the environment has hit a record high, with more than 40 per cent of the UK population putting it in their top three issues facing the country.Fear for the future of the planet has quadrupled since 2018 - when it was listed as a major concern by just 10 per cent of Britons.? The carbon footprint of Cop26 is expected to be twice as large as the previous summit on climate change, making it the worst of its kind.A report for the UK Government by consultants Arup states 102,500 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (tCO2e) will have been released by the summit in Glasgow. Madrid hosted Cop25 in 2019, which produced 51,101 tCO2e.Quoting the report, The Scotsman newspaper said around 60 per cent of this comes from international flights.A spokesman for the UK Government said: 'Cop26 is a substantially bigger event than other recent Cops.'",Copyright 2021 Associated Newpapers Ltd.

The teams in Pittsburgh and Glasgow that have been working on the sister-city relationship ""have been developing climate innovation and sustainability goals together.""""We have already learned a lot from each other,"" leader of Glasgow City Council Susan Aitken said, ""but this partnership will draw Glasgow and Pittsburgh closer together than ever before - and provides an opportunity for us to show real leadership on the climate emergency and building back from the COVID-19 pandemic in a way that prioritizes economic, social and environmental justice for all our people.""City officials said Pittsburgh currently has 18 sister cities including Saitama City, Japan; Bilbao, Spain; Wuhan, China; and Da Nang, Vietnam. Grant Ervin, Pittsburgh's chief resilience officer, said it is important for cities to have global partners ""now more than ever.""""By partnering with cities like Glasgow, Pittsburgh can promote our innovation economy to the world and open up opportunities for our region.

Now they're good business sense;The key to impactful environmental change begins with SMEs, finds John Arlidge","November 12, 2021 Friday",Non-jurisdictional,The Evening Standard (London),News,447,NEWS;Pg. 16,447,,John Arlidge,,,,"Sustainable practices? Now they're good business senseThe key to impactful environmental change begins with SMEs, finds John Arlidge","ROB WILSON wants to save the world - with beer. The firm he co-founded and runs, Toast Ale, uses bread that would otherwise be wasted to make its award-winning beverages. ""We brew all of our beer using yesterday's bread from bakeries,"" he explains. ""Bread is the biggest food waste in the UK; 44 per cent of all loaves baked are wasted. We mix the old bread in with the barley and every pint of beer we produce prevents a slice of bread from going to waste.""As COP26 enters its final stages, the adoption of sustainable practices such as this has never been higher on the agenda for businesses. And Toast Ale's efforts are themselves good business. It makes around one million pints of beer a year and is profitable but it does not pay its founders big salaries. Instead, it reinvests in the business and gives the rest to environmental charities fighting food waste. Its latest hit product is the COP26 case - 26 cans of beer for £89.95. For each case bought, £26 is donated to eco charities.Wilson's company is founded on ethical principles. But even long-standing businesses need to embrace high ethical and social standards, he says. ""Customers increasingly expect it, staff often demand it and it's the right thing to do. SMEs can put profit, planet, people all together, in equal measure, to create a triple bottom line - a win, win, win."" It's a message he will drive home at the Evening Standard SME XPO in February.Peter Flavel, Coutts bank's chief executive, agrees with the importance for businesses to be on the right side of the debate on social responsibility. He argues COP26 is a turning point.""Until this year, it was mainly governments and NGOs that attended but for the first time there was a significant delegation of CEOs. SMEs were represented... Real traction can be gained by making sure they are engaged with the idea of profit through purpose.""Like Toast Ale, Coutts became aB Corp - which certifies that a company is achieving the highest social and environmental standards - this year and is encouraging others to follow its lead.Bigger players can learn a few things from SMEs when it comes to social responsibility, says founder of luxury circular fashion resale website Hewi (Hardly Ever Worn It), Tatiana Wolter-Ferguson, who will also attend SME XPO. ""Large corporations can't change overnight. Companies like Hewi are more agile, closer to customers, so we can be the disruptors, the ones that can act quickly and nimbly and get ahead on the latest trends.""Connecting the UK's most ambitious businessesFEBRUARY 23 & 24, 2022 AT OLYMPIA LONDONSME XPO, from the Evening Standard, takes place at Olympia London.

Vanessa Nakate, a climate activist from Uganda, on Thursday called out business leaders and investors, saying they had not taken immediate action but instead were “flying into COP on private jets” and “making fancy speeches.”Previous climate summits had much smaller carbon footprints, including COP25 in Madrid in 2019, which emitted the equivalent of 51,101 tons of carbon dioxide.Not all COP events leave behind a carbon footprint. The host government for COP20 in Lima, Peru, in 2014 offset all emissions, according to the United Nations.Cansin Leylim of 350.org, an organization working to end the age of fossil fuels, said the focus should not be on the summit’s emission numbers.“The question shouldn’t be how do we reduce emissions at these type of events, but how do we speed up the phasing out all fossil fuels, end fossil finance and leverage the climate finance needed to support a global just transition, so that we don’t have to have these type of conferences in the first place,” she said.Dr. Stephen Allen, an expert on energy and carbon analysis at the University of Bath in England, said in-person negotiations were sometimes critical to progress on issues like climate change.“It is a big number,” he said of the summit’s projected carbon footprint. “But it is essential that we get an international commitment. I suppose in a way, we’re investing carbon emissions in trying to secure a good international agreement that then leads to really big carbon savings.”PHOTO: At the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow.

The COP26 ""cover text"" will determine how fast nations move over the next decade to cut emissions. But nations are split on how ambitious it should be, and COP26's UK hosts yesterday delayed a move to release a fresh text as they try to forge an agreement.First drafts included calls for emissions to be cut by 45 per cent by 2030, and called on countries to come to the next COP next year with fresh plans to cut carbon this decade. While many ""high ambition"" countries welcome this, some nations including Bolivia, India and China immediately called for this to be struck from the text, saying only developed nations needed to deliver carbon cuts.The move to include a call to phase out fossil fuel subsidies is also a major sticking point. The paragraph was inserted at the request of small island states, but oil-rich Saudi Arabia wants it gone.Money to help countries adapt to the impacts of climate change is the final major hurdle. Most climate finance has gone towards cutting emissions but many poorer nations want more cash support to cope with wilder weather, such as sea defences and more resilient power grids.The current draft calls for rich countries to double funding for adaptation, but poorer countries want reassurance they will get more money in a timely fashion.Madeleine Cuff",Copyright 2021 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

237,Then or now? Attitudes to car-free life stuck on repeat,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Herald (Glasgow),News,1024,Pg. 15,1024,Scotland,Catriona Stewart ,,,,Then or now? Attitudes to car-free life stuck on repeat,"IF there's one thing that gives honest citizens the collywobbles, it's talk of cutting car use.Yesterday, Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken announced that Glasgow city centre will become pedestrianised. A large section of the heart of Glasgow will be redesigned to make more space for people walking; to create safer routes for people wheeling and cycling; to cut congestion and lower carbon emissions; to make public transport faster and more efficient; and to create a welcoming, green city centre.The main takeaway, though, was: ""What? But our cars!"" Yes, private vehicles will be removed - though provisions made for people with disabilities - but so much more will be added.Let's play a quick game. I'll call it ""Then or Now"". In response to road changes, a reader of The Herald wrote thus in our Letters page: ""I am amazed and horrified at what is happening regarding traffic management throughout Glasgow."" Then or now? This was 2000.Another letter to the editor reflects on the impact of a new bus gate in the city centre. ""There will be a loss of a great number of jobs and subsequent reduction in the commercial rate income to Glasgow City Council."" Then or now? Again, 2000. Written by a business owner whose shop, 21 years later, is still there. As is the bus gate.Victoria Road, on Glasgow's southside, has been undergoing multiple traffic transformations. ""Drivers, local businesses and motoring organisations condemned the moves as ill-conceived and poorly executed,"" was reported in this paper. Then or now? July 1997, in response to a new traffic system. The road is now part of a  £6.5 million cycle lane scheme called the South City Way, which has also been subjected to hearty naysaying.Speaking of cycle lanes, a reader writes: ""Cycle lanes: Where is the mandate for this agenda? How much money has been spent on them throughout the city? Does the council seriously expect a significant number of people to start cycling to work?"" Then or now? Answer: June 2000.""See an integrated transport strategy? Not in Glasgow you won't!"" Then or now? Letter to The Herald from June 2000.  ""The Labour administration both in Holyrood and Glasgow are addressing the need for a fully-integrated transport system."" The clue's there in the line - it's 2000.Change the administration and 21 years later, we're still there. A letter writer with whom I cannot argue tells this paper: ""Instead of complaining that 'anti-car' policies are unfair, we should all look at ourselves. Dare I suggest that many consider public transport to be for poor people, cycling for fitness freaks, and walking for recreation only?"" You'll have guessed -it's then. Or 1999, to be precise.What about this: ""We all know that cyclists, whether on path, road or common, have a sense of absolute entitlement to do whatever they want to do."" Then or now? This week, actually. Judge Alan Saggerson in central London  granting an appeal.Cheers, guv. How about this one? ""I've only spoken to three people who back it - one doesn't drive a car and one is an environmentalist."" That's now, a Glasgow west end resident in response to new parking restrictions proposed for north Kelvin and north Woodside, where about 2,000 residents have signed a petition against them.People feel penalised when they can't park outside their homes for free. In this instance, the permits cost £85 for residential properties, which isn't a punitive sum, and it's possible to buy visitor permits at £2 for four hours if you have friends come to stay.So, a nuisance, but manageable. In all the cases mentioned here, the situation 20 years ago mimicked situations now. Reactions were similarly scornful, frustrated or outraged and yet the predicted falling of sky never occurred. Victoria Road is not dead. It suffered a decline that had very little to do with nearby streets becoming one-way and it is now undergoing a renaissance, despite a new bike lane and floating bus stops.People are well able to travel to work in the city centre, there is not increased congestion and yes, some of the one-way systems are a bit surprising, but don't we all navigate them smoothly now? The mass love affair with our cars continues because of another problem that has barely changed in the past two decades - the lack of a properly integrated public transport system.In London this week, two British Airways and Virgin Atlantic aeroplanes took off simultaneously at Heathrow to mark the reopening of US borders to leisure travellers since Covid-19 closed them in March 2020.On one hand, you appreciate their enthusiasm after an agonising 18 months apart for many friends and families, alongside the significant loss of trade for the industry. On the other hand, it seemed a tone-deaf clanger during COP26. Up the road in Glasgow, folk were just asking for a joined-up local transport system. If a one-size-fits-all travel ticket can be magicked up for COP26 delegates then it can be sorted out after years of pleading by Greater Glasgow residents.If concerns still exist that not being able to drive to George Square will kill the city centre, then maybe we need to look at the parking options at out-of-town malls. Do we start charging people for parking at car-centric shopping centres? We certainly have to make public transport more accessible. My mother lives an eight-minute drive from Glasgow Fort but there's no way to get there by public transport. I live 20 minutes away by car at the other side of the city but there's a bus taking me directly there. That's nonsensical.To get people out of their cars we have to offer them real alternatives that won't hugely inconvenience them. The absolutely frustrating thing is that this isn't in any way a new observation either.""Two Jags"" John Prescott announced at COP26 he's given up his cars. The former deputy prime minister, famous for his gas-guzzling vehicle addiction, claims to be keen to cut his carbon emissions but, at 83, he's perhaps decided to slow down as much as anything.Sort out public transport and make cycling more attractive. It's so simple and yet will we still be here, in 2042, playing the same game?

239,US-China rhetoric won't solve our climate woes if Beijing stays hooked on coal,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,City A.M.,News,578,NEWS;Pg. 17,578,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Julia Pamilih,,,,US-China rhetoric won't solve our climate woes if Beijing stays hooked on coal,"IN A MOVE reminiscent of the Obama era, the US and China announced a joint agreement on climate change, taking Cop26 attendees by surprise. This commitment to cooperation comes laden with symbolism in a backdrop of wider, intractable tensions in the US-China relationship. But signs of concrete plans remain mysterious.The joint declaration made between the US and China - both strategic rivals and the world's largest emitters - reaffirmed two main goals. The first is the importance of efforts to limit global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees. The second is the vague commitment to cooperation on ""enhanced climate action"" throughout the 2020s.However, the fact there was an agreement at all is a marked shift from the confrontational tone that has characterised the US-China relationship over the last five years. In the context of Cop26, China's willingness to play ball is, in itself, a hopeful sign that a substantive pledge on climate can be reached in the future.Without China, we won't move the needle on global emissions. So while scepticism about China's sincerity would not be misplaced, there is movement; it's an open door to something many, prior to the summit, thought would be kept firmly shut. When President Xi Jinping refused to attend Cop26, many saw it as a failure of climate talks before they even began.But while the high-level optics are promising, the details offer little substance.The question is still how far China is willing to go in the face of significant obstacles. The agreement steers towards methane, but China refused to sign up to the US-led global pact to cut methane emissions by 2030. While the test sees China agree to ""phase down"" coal consumption, there's no real plans to wind down its domestic acceleration of coal-fired power stations.John Kerry, the US climate lead, chose his words carefully, saying the two sides had agreed ""to accelerate and phase down unabated coal as fast as is achievable."" Xie Zhenhua, China's top climate official avoided answering further questions about a coal phase out.And there are big gaps: China bringing forward its 2030 peak emissions pledge, an emissions or coal use cap, a global carbon market, or concrete details of green finance and capacity building in developing countries.It is telling that China's biggest event this week is not in Glasgow, but 5,000 miles away in Beijing. The Chinese Communist Party has just concluded its Sixth Plenum, a headline political meeting that will lay the groundwork for the 20th Party Congress in 2022, where Xi will almost certainly seal an unprecedented third term.The CCP issued its first ""historical resolution"" for 40 years, setting out a new version of history that justifies Xi's third term. This is a major power grab. Meanwhile, China has been plagued by power shortages this autumn, an unhelpful sidebar to the narrative that Xi's leadership is ""the key to great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation"". As Beijing shored up power supply ahead of the winter, China's daily coal output hit a multi year peak this week.When regime stability is under threat, it has become a tradition to turn to coal. This trajectory will uphold its place at the largest emitter. Until China signals a plan to turn its commitments into actions, rhetoric will do little but falsely buoy up the hopes of the world.£ Julia Pamilih is Director of the China Research GroupChina is the largest emitter because it turns to coal when regime stability is under threat",Copyright 2021 City A.M.

240,We Scots practically invented climate change - Readers' Leters,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Scotsman,News,1672,LETTERS,1672,Scotland,Readers' Letters,,,,We Scots practically invented climate change - Readers' Leters,"James Watt invented the steam engine in 1776, allowing us to create energy from burning coal to start with. His student and protege William Murdoch aka “The Maker of Light” created gas lighting in the 1790s, which has evolved to become one of the most energy intensive functions we indulge ourselves in on the planet today. John Boyd Dunlop invented the pneumatic tyre in 1887, giving us the option of running cars on the tarmacadam roads previously developed by John Loudon McAdam in the early 1800s.It goes much further than that. The invention of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in 1928 has saved the lives of hundreds of millions of people and contributed hugely to population increases around the globe. John Logie Baird invented television in 1926 and allowed us to see the world beyond our own immediate environment, thereby helping to give us ideas above our station and encouraging consumerism. The earlier invention of the telephone by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876 has now promoted the extensive mining of toxic metals, often undertaken by child labour.The refrigerator was invented by a Scot, William Cullen in 1748, enabling us to transport food around the planet, taking us away from local food supplies and encouraging destruction of faraway habitats and cultures.Even when you are quietly looking out the window contemplating these things in the morning, just think of the heat being generated by that toaster, invented by Scot Alan MacMasters in 1893. If you think the bathroom is the only escape from all this, Visit the bathroom and even the humble S-bend was invented by a Scot Alexander Cumming in 1755, and think about the water usage promoted by that, in all our homes, every day, and throughout the world.There is no doubt about it. We Scots have practically invented climate change. Surely no other nation has made a bigger contribution. In the spirit of making a superficial and meaningless gesture, I think I might change that tea towel, although that too would result in unnecessary waste if everyone started doing it.Victor Clements, Aberfeldy, Perth and KinrossUnwilling to act$100 billion seems a lot to most people dealing with economies of daily life, never mind climate chaos. This is the money promised at a previous COP some years ago, but still not delivered by the developed world (that caused most of the problems) to help the developing world (that suffers most of the consequences).Let's put that in the context of not only the cost of fires and floods across the world or the islands that will disappear or the disruption to the fishing industry.The USA alone had a budget of $770 billion on military spending for the one year of 2020. We could add some of the other big military spenders: China $252bn; India $72.9bn; Russia $61.7bnl and of course the UK at $59.2bn.Meanwhile the major oil companies such as Shell and Siccar Poin will make the situation much worse by opening the Cambo oil field costing more than $5bn.The money is obviously there but the political will definitely is not. Unless we make our politicians pay by voting them out, at every opportunity, they will continue to lie and try to fool and blame us.Norman Lockhart, Innerleithen, Scottish BordersSturgeon’s burdenJane Lax berates Nicola Sturgeon for being seen in the company of Alan Cumming (Letters, 11 November).I’m not an SNP voter and I fully realise that governments and politicians must be held to account, but it seems to me sometimes, that were Nicola Sturgeon to help an old lady across the street, there would be outraged letters from some of your regular correspondents (they know who they are) complaining that she was holding up the traffic.Michael Grey, EdinburghDivine revelationNo matter how we try to convince ourselves that our civilization rests on the rational foundation of the Enlightenment, the politics and social behavior of broad sectors of our society suggest otherwise and we seem to be trapped in the same atavistic behavioral patterns as our ancestors.Humans appear to have an inner need for renunciation, limitation, and self-punishment that becomes active when we face danger, real or invented. The Covid restrictions and climate politics of recent years clearly satisfy a deep-seated spiritual need for sacrifice, repentance and submission.Radical movements emerge like Extinction Rebellion and Zero Covid demanding ever more extreme measures and reminiscent of the Black Death’s flagellation processions. Instead of appealing to the Bible they invoke ""the science” which, to all intents and purposes, fulfills the same function.The West stands accused of sinful living with its materialism, consumption and enjoyment of life.In addition, there are heretics: sceptics who undermine the grand moral purification with their doubts. For this we’ll be punished by God/Gaia sending viruses, diseases, floods and droughts.Science is invoked as an authority, not to examine or overturn existing assumptions, but to confirm accepted views. Scientists are the heralds, the voices of conscience, functions once the role of priests. In the West it has become a substitute religion and a source of divine revelation.Rev Dr John Cameron, St Andrews, Fife‘Benefits’ for MPsRegarding the current controversy over MPs earning large amounts of money from jobs on the side, sometimes working overseas and being unavailable in person for their constituency duties, not to mention unable to attend their place of work, might I suggest that there are already rules, sanctioned by Parliament, for people receiving payment from the state, which might be appropriately applied to MPs, in order to ensure that they comply with reasonable rules for their conduct, and meet the terms of their entitlement.READ MORE: Geoffrey Cox MP's trip to British Virgin Islands sets a precedent we would all enjoy – Scotsman commentFor example, every fortnight they must attend their constituency, or face sanctions; they must provide evidence of their constituency work; and they must declare any change in circumstances, such as extra income, which will then be deducted from their pay.These conditions are already applied to people receiving state benefits, presumably approved as fair by Parliament, and, as MPs are also in receipt of benefits, so to speak, from the state, I don’t see any reason why our MPs shouldn’t be subject to the same general rules.Les MackayDundeeWhat’s the word?What's the more likely derivation of ""Tory"" – old Irish ""toraidhe"" (thief, villain) or ""toerag"" (contemptible or worthless person)? I'm spoilt for choice, frankly.Steve Hayes, Leven, FifeCycle of violenceHuman beings are capable of committing the most heinous crimes against their fellow humans. They also have the capacity to do, not as they would be done by, but as they were done by. Children who have been victims of abuse, and have known no kindness or love from their parents, may behave in similar ways towards their own children, despite vowing never to do so. This is what they know about parenting, and they act without thinking about or analysing their behaviour. Thus, abuse is passed down the generations.The same unreflective process can be seen in the situation in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories, where groups of young men have recently been reported to be marching through Haifa, in northern Israel, carrying Israeli flags and shouting “Death to Arabs!”.Palestinian citizens who survived the ethnic cleansing of Palestine in 1948, to make way for Jewish immigrants during the founding of Israel, make up about 20 per cent of of Israel’s population. Racism against them is encouraged by Israeli politicians and parties, whose goal is to maintain a Jewish majority in Israel.The children of Palestinians face an uncertain future. They have learnt that the meek will not inherit the earth, and no amount of patience and stoicism will change their situation. They have also learnt that those who profess to have God on their side are no more entitled to this claim than they are.Carolyn Taylor, Broughty Ferry, DundeeRefugee crisisRefugees should not be footballs, and free Europe should not be checkmated by the manœuvres of dictators.READ MORE: German chancellor Angela Merkel asks Vladimir Putin to intervene with Belarus over migrants at Polish borderEuropean states have the logistical power to act properly for the abused migrants at the border of Poland.

No migrant should remain the plaything of criminals like Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko. If anything, his own citizens need to get in the queue.Tim Cox, Bern, SwitzerlandNumbers gameAlex Orr can juggle as many anti-Brexit figures as he pleases (Letters, 10 November) but this statistical indignation ignores some elephants in the room.No mention that only 19 per cent of Scotland's exports go to the EU; we actually conduct more commerce with the rest of the world, which we can now engage in unfettered by single market regulations. The fact that rUK accounts for nearly two thirds of our trade is also apparently irrelevant.The SNP leadership only favours re-entry to Europe because it is a convenient stick to beat the Tories with and they dream of extending the begging bowl to Brussels, which they see as a surrogate Westminster.Martin O’Gorman, EdinburghWrite to The ScotsmanWe welcome your thoughts.

241,What on earth was Boris Johnson doing? That's the question every journalist was asking this week,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),News,581,"INDEPENDENT PREMIUM,EDITOR'S LETTERS;Version:1",581,England & Wales,Andrew Woodcock,,,,What on earth was Boris Johnson doing? That's the question every journalist was asking this week,"Along with the arcane details of the rules on MPs' second jobs, the mind-boggling puzzle which has been bending the brains of journalists and MPs in Westminster this week boils down to a simple question: what on earth did Boris Johnson  think he was doing?This was the week, after all, which he had lined up as his moment to be hailed as the saviour of the world by securing a big deal on climate change at the Cop26  summit in Glasgow.Instead, TV viewers from around the globe were presented with the unedifying spectacle of a British prime minister - in a press conference abruptly truncated after just 22 minutes - being repeatedly asked to apologise for trying to undermine his own country's democratic procedures and being forced to declare to the millions watching that the UK is not a corrupt country.Since he became PM, Mr Johnson has never ceased reminding people of the opportunity provided by the hosting of the United Nations conference - following the G7 in Cornwall in June - to put the UK at the heart of global diplomacy and send the ""global Britain"" message around the world.Given these high hopes, ""We're not corrupt"" can hardly have been the message he wanted to send.For a politician who loves the chance to shine on a big stage, Mr Johnson seems to have been remarkably insouciant about preparing the ground for his big moment.Rather than clearing his diary of anything not climate-related and turning a laser focus on the minutiae of the agreement being ground out in Glasgow, he appeared more preoccupied with preserving MPs' perks in Westminster.His botched attempt to save Owen Paterson  from the inconvenience of a 30-day suspension from the Commons ensured that during the crucial week of climate negotiations, headlines were dominated by sleaze not trees.Tory MPs insist that they gave whips plenty of warning that they weren't happy being ordered to back a scheme which seemed so blatantly to be manipulating Westminster's standards procedures for the benefit of one of their colleagues.And they are now throwing their hands up in horror at the casual way their leader has revived the spectre of sleaze which inflicted so much harm on the Tories  in the 1990s.Explanations being bandied around privately by Tory MPs are not complimentary towards Johnson. Some say he lost interest in Cop as soon as the razzmatazz left town along with fellow leaders like Joe Biden last week, others that he was too lazy and undisciplined to engage with the details of the negotiation or too complacent in the security of his 80-seat majority to consider the damage he might inflict while trying to help out an old comrade of the Brexit battle.Others think he is nursing a grudge against the standards commissioner for finding against him in the past and was all too eager to jump on an opportunity to stop her doing it again.Whatever the truth of the matter, there can be little doubt that the image of prime ministerial disengagement and disarray is not the message Mr Johnson hoped to send the rest of the world this week.Yours,Andrew WoodcockPolitical editor Read MorePM insists Britain 'not remotely corrupt country' amid sleaze rowBoris Johnson under pressure at Cop26 as 'huge amount' yet to be doneEU and UK are playing chicken - and we still can't get Brexit doneHow Labour and Lib Dems are using the sleaze scandal to their advantageOpinion: Keir Starmer has slipped up in his assault on Tory ethical standardsWhy is Boris Johnson being accused of 'cash for votes'?",Copyright 2021 Independent Digital News and Media Limited All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper; Web Publication|WEBI|ENGLISH|HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENTJOURNALISMPRIME MINISTERSWRITERSNEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWSUK CONSERVATIVE PARTYAGREEMENTSBRITISH PARLIAMENTBRITISH PRIME MINISTERSDIARY KEEPING & JOURNALINGPOLITICAL CORRUPTIONPOLITICAL PARTIESPRESS CONFERENCESREPORTS, REVIEWS & SECTIONSINTERNATIONAL RELATIONSCONFERENCES & CONVENTIONSBREXITUS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016UNITED NATIONSUNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONSLETTERS & COMMENTS|WRITERS|BORIS JOHNSONJOE BIDEN|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|UNITED KINGDOM",
242,"When it comes to climate, China wins either way","November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Australian,News,1087,COMMENTARY;Pg. 11,1087,Australia,ALAN DUPONT,,,,"When it comes to climate, China wins either way","Don't think that Australia's climate wars are at an end.They are only going to intensify as international tensions over the timeline for decarbonisation of the world economy threaten new geopolitical fault lines that will widen domestic divides.Tensions with our allies over climate policy have not been put to rest. At COP26 in Glasgow this week, the former United States president, Barack Obama, lashed out at China and Russia for not doing ""nearly enough"" to address the climate crisis.But the main international fault line is between energy-deficient developing countries that want more time and money to switch from fossil fuels, and governments of advanced economies committed to speeding up the transition to renewables.Public opinion in developed countries and corporate money have swung behind the need to rapidly move away from fossil fuels. COP26 has reinforced this trend.More than 100 world leaders attended the Glasgow conference in person. Significant, though qualified, agreements have been signed to reverse deforestation, end coal production and reduce methane emissions underlined by the agreement between the US and China to ramp up co-operation on climate change.But despite these achievements, only the most sanguine of optimists can now believe that temperature increases will be kept to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, the recognised benchmark for a generally benign climate.Emissions will continue to rise in China, India and Russia.Many countries have failed to match their promises to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the agreed level, making it far more likely temperatures will rise above 2C.The world's leading climate scientists are in little doubt about what this will mean for all of us.A 2C-plus warmer world will not be a pleasant place to live. More frequent extreme weather events such as the destructive bushfires that ravaged Australia's east coast early last year will place serious pressure on human habitation, freshwater availability and food supplies.Logic suggests we should do everything possible to prevent this climate future. But energy realities threaten to trump logic and emotion.Although there has been demonstrable progress in moving the developed world to renewables, poorer countries are still heavily reliant on fossil fuels and will remain so for decades.For them, the here and now challenges of economic growth, jobs and energy security are paramount.Eco-fundamentalists do their own cause a disservice by insisting on unrealistic time frames to accomplish the most complex and difficult economic transition in history.Support for action on climate change in the developing world ranks well below the level of concern evinced in Australia, North America and Europe.That's why big emitters such as China and India have resisted pressure at COP26 to commit to ambitious 2030 emission reduction targets and net zero emissions by 2050. But China also sees geopolitical opportunity in the climate wars that are aggravating political divisions within and between the advanced economies.It hasn't gone unnoticed in Beijing that Quadrilateral Security Dialogue members India and Australia are more aligned with China than the United States on climate policy.Reassuring images of allied unity during the recently signed AUKUS agreement contrast sharply with Australia's refusal to sing from the same policy song sheet as the US and Britain by eliminating coal and signing up to methane reductions.Despite producing 31 per cent of the world's greenhouse gases, Beijing has deflected criticism of its weak environmental credentials, a task made easier by the ideological blindness of climate change activists.Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg rails against the real and imagined policy failings of the West but refuses to criticise China even though it burns half the world's coal. Some of the more than $US500bn ($685bn) Beijing allocates to its defence and security apparatuses annually would be better spent on securing the health of our shared environment.Instead, China's spurious claim to developing country status buys time not afforded to Australia to wean itself off reliance on fossil fuels and dominate the market for renewables.China already produces 70 per cent of solar panels, has seven of the top wind turbine manufacturers and is a major player in the booming electric vehicle market. Allowing the world's biggest emitter and user of coal 10 years longer than developed countries to become carbon neutral reduces its energy costs while driving up those of competitors.The technological advantage enjoyed by the West in the production of internal combustion engines is being swept away as they are replaced by EVs, levelling the playing field. Either way, China wins.Far from being the -result of superior foresight and planning, China's emerging technology pre-eminence is primarily due to the ability of state-supported enterprises to undercut the -prices of Western firms and control whole ecosystems.This reinforces China's market dominance and creates new dependencies that can be exploited for economic and geopolitical gain, as Australia has found to its cost.Scott Morrison needs to make sure his EV strategy is not as China dependent as our trade in resources and education services.The Biden administration errs in believing co-operation with China on climate change can be separated from tendentious areas of the relationship. Beijing explicitly rejects compartmentalisation.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi made this clear in September, warning: ""US-China climate change co-operation cannot be separated from the larger environment of US-China relations."" President Xi Jinping is a devout practitioner of linkage diplomacy in which all elements of national power are harnessed in pursuit of specific foreign policy goals.Climate policy is no exception. Xi believes US pressure to make deep emission cuts is part of a strategy to limit China's growth and contain its rise.This means he's unlikely to speed up decarbonisation of the economy or burn less coal; quite the opposite.Last year China built more than three times as much new coal power capacity as all other countries in the world combined and plans to add another 43 new coal-fired power plants.The inconvenient truth is that unless China can be persuaded or pressured to reverse course, we are all going to be living in a much hotter world.

243,Will threat to our own health spark change?,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Evening Times (Glasgow),News,751,Pg. 18,751,Scotland,Stuart Sandler ,,,,Will threat to our own health spark change?,"IT'S been quite a time for us here in Glasgow with COP26 these last couple of weeks. Having been cited as our last chance of hope at tackling the climate emergency, it is important we understand that it's not just about saving the planet; climate change is closely linked to our own health.We have heard some of the speeches, maybe caught some sound bites from very important leaders attending the climate change conference, but has it been enough to spark the change we really need?I recently went around the city centre of Glasgow as part of a project to interview some members of the general public about their thoughts on climate change. It was really interesting for me to hear the huge range of view points from people of mixed ages and backgrounds but one thing that struck me was how little we understood the impact of climate change on our own health and wellbeing.My children have been learning about climate change at school and nursery and it has warmed my heart that they are being educated on such an important topic, one that truly impacts their future.We depend on our planet to be both healthy and thriving because not only does it give us food, and water, it supplies us with the air we need to survive. However, the stark reality is that we are destroying these basic resources at a catastrophic rate, with huge emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere. The knock-on effect on our plants and our wildlife too ultimately mounts a significant impact on our health - we are all connected.Humans however are selfish beings, never truly appreciating how their actions now could affect us tomorrow. As we have greedily sought to secure more energy, have more food and build more and more, at each stage we have risked global human health. We really need to action change fast.My son has been learning all about fossil fuels at school recently, something I'm learning more about too. How to reduce the burning of fossil fuels has been one of the main talking points at COP26 and it's something we all need to understand why. Fossil fuels are formed from burning the fossilised remains of dead animals and plants, all to get carbon containing energy eg. Crude oil, natural gas and coal.Coal burning is a huge problem and there are some countries that are burning way more than others but the problem is that it affects everyone.Coal and crude oil burning not only releases carbon dioxide and methane, two of the worst greenhouse gases, but it also releases sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury into the air - all of which are harmful to human health.Over the years, as air pollution has become a leading public health issue, there has been a coinciding increase in the number of people with heart and lung conditions.We've long known that those who work in coal mines are at a much higher risk of developing lung diseases like emphysema and bronchitis; both conditions obstruct airways and make it difficult to breathe. Those who live near coal stations and breathe in the air that contains the harmful components that coal-burning releases, are also at higher risk of suffering from these conditions.Nitrogen oxide is another very toxic gas that targets a specific protein in our lungs, reducing the functionality of the airways, making you more short of breath. Interestingly, inhaling some of these chemicals can also have a dangerous effect on the heart muscle, blood vessels as well as memory, fertility and menstrual cycles.While you might be thinking, ""well I'm not burning any of these things so I must be ok,""unfortunately the carbon footprint is something that we are all influencing on some level. We haven't chosen the world to be in such a crisis but along the way, we have been complicit and now it's time to all take some personal responsibility.It's hard to listen to the leaders and government authorities because they've long been aware and been warned of the risks and links between poor air quality and health; sadly nothing has really been done about it. I'm hopeful that the discussions from COP26 will lead to improving our air quality globally.However, we must also all review our own contributions and change what we can ... the smallest change will go a long way. From being more mindful of energy use around the house to opting to walk where you can, from recycling and reusing to eating more plant-based foods - the impact together can be huge.

""It's the 26th Cop so at some point you have to ask yourself the question, 'are we going to keep on coming and talking about this all the time?' "" she asked.It had been established that global warming was a systemic problem. But when young activists came Cop26 solutions were still being considered in the framework of business as usual, said Ms Molay. ""So where are the justice and equity elements in that?"" she asked.Personally, she found it upsetting that the EU bloc in talking about ""loss and damage"", and increasing adaptation targets, was doing so within a framework of charity. She added: ""Is it charity or reparation that we are talking out?""To solve the climate crisis was not just about cutting greenhouse gases, she said. ""It must be while changing the system that created the problem in the first place."" The Irish activists had an hour-long meeting with Minister for Climate Action Eamon Ryan in Glasgow, where she said the exclusion issue was highlighted.Ms Molay said it was emotional for her hearing from people at the meeting talking about themselves and how overwhelming the climate issue was, as indicated by one person saying, ""I started this at 13, now I'm going to college, I can't continue doing this"".",Copyright 2021 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|CLIMATE CHANGETALKS & MEETINGSEUROPEAN UNIONENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICENEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSSOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE & LIFESTYLEUNITED NATIONSUNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONSGLOBAL WARMINGGREENHOUSE GASESEMOTIONSCORONAVIRUSESVIRUSES|GLOBAL WARMING|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|IRELANDEUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES",

Mr Jorgensen said they were in conversations with other countries, including Scotland, and wanted to spark the debate over future production.Questioned on Wednesday on whether the UK would support the alliance to phase out oil and gas, the Prime Minister did not rule it out - saying he wanted to move beyond hydrocarbons completely in the UK.On Wednesday, the United States and China published a declaration that they would work together on enhancing emissions-cutting action in the 2020s to meet the goals of the Paris climate accord to limit global warming to ""well below"" 2C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5C.

The world knows what a mess our planet is in. The world has heard leaders from every country, every continent, stand here and acknowledge the need for action. And the world will find it absolutely incomprehensible if we fail to deliver that.""The backlash from people will be immense and long-lasting, and frankly we will deserve their criticism and their opprobrium.""While Australia has committed to reducing emissions to net zero by 2050, the Morrison government declined to lift its 2030 target of reducing emissions by 26 to 28 per cent. Prime Minister Scott Morrison forecast a 35 per cent cut to emissions by 2030 in Glasgow, however it is not a binding target.The terms of a draft Glasgow accord would give nations that have not submitted ""new or updated"" 2030 targets another 12 months to ""revisit and strengthen"" their emissions-reduction effort.The Australian government and other countries are working to have that element altered or removed. Australia is also unhappy with another proposal which calls on nations to speed up the phase-out of coal and fossil-fuel subsidies.There is a strong expectation that the final language will be softened or removed by the time a deal is completed today.Asked whether watering down the draft text would imperil the goal of limiting temperature rises to 1.5 degrees, Mr Johnson replied: ""The risk of sliding back, I think, would be an absolute disaster for the planet.""Energy Minister Angus Taylor said Australia was an ""active and constructive participant in the negotiations to ensure a positive outcome for COP26"".",Copyright 2021 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|EMISSIONSHEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENTPRIME MINISTERSENERGY DEPARTMENTSGOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERSBRITISH PRIME MINISTERS|EMISSIONSENERGY & UTILITIESENERGY DEPARTMENTS|BORIS JOHNSONSCOTT MORRISON|GLASGOW, SCOTLANDMELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA|VICTORIA, AUSTRALIAEARTH|AUSTRALIAUNITED KINGDOM",

The brackets in the text reflect unresolved issues of finance, adaptation, loss & damage and carbon market (Article 6). On a positive note, the text for the first time called for acceleration of the phase-out of coal and fossil fuel subsidies.Though the ministers pledged full support to the UK COP26 Presidency for a successful conference, they asked the developed countries to honour their pre-2020 commitments regarding mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation, without transferring any burden to developing countries. It is believed that the 'carbon border tax', being pushed by the EU nations, will impact manufacturing and exports in developing countries, primarily in India and China.

252,B.C. looks to book carbon credits for reforestation,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Globe and Mail (Canada),News,812,NEWS;Pg. A6,812,Canada,JUSTINE HUNTER,,,,B.C. looks to book carbon credits for reforestation,"LeadBritish Columbia's New Democratic Party government announced a reforestation milestone this week, with one billion new trees planted since taking power.Since 2018, the first planting season after the NDP formed government, the province has ramped up its tree-planting program, replacing forests that have been logged, lost to wildfires or destroyed by mountain pine beetle infestation.Texte/TextNow, the province wants to expand its program to book carbon credits for the effort - a climateaction accounting tactic that has been widely criticized by environmentalists.B.C. Environment Minister George Heyman says the 300 million seedlings planted this year will increase the carbon-capture capacity of the province's forests and reduce emissions over the long term. Heading into this month's COP26 summit on climate, his assignment was to explore opportunities to partner with the federal government to plant more trees as a way to restore lands that absorb more carbon than they emit into the atmosphere.At the same time, the province wants to widen the scope of its BC Forest Carbon Offset Protocol to expand access to its carbon-offset market so more Indigenous communities and forest companies can turn reforestation and better forest-management activities into marketable carbon credits.B.C. doesn't count the carbon removed from the atmosphere from forest management projects in its main inventory of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Since 2007, B.C.'s GHG tally has increased by 5 per cent - despite more than a decade of policy changes designed to reduce emissions.It does, however, keep a separate set of books on GHG emissions that includes credit for tree planting. By that accounting, the province's GHGs have increased by only 2 per cent. That looks better, but only because the province does not include the GHG emissions caused by wildfires in its inventory.Canada has a rich store of natural carbon sinks, which take up some of the carbon dioxide emitted by burning fossil fuels. B.C.'s old-growth forests make up an important part of that picture, but the climate benefits are lost when those forests and other landscape features are disrupted.""We're losing our forest carbon stores in places like B.C. as a result of fires, clear-cut logging, and the other impacts of climate change,"" said Shane Moffatt, head of Greenpeace Canada's nature and food campaign. If B.C.accounted for the GHGs released into the atmosphere as a result of wildfires, the picture changes substantially: B.C.'s forests become net emitters of carbon dioxide.More importantly, he said, the trade in forest carbon offsets is being used as cover to allow polluters to continue pushing the planet closer to a climate catastrophe.""The scientific case for using forests as an excuse to keep pumping out greenhouse gas emissions would be a disaster for Canada's climate ambitions, and is no solution to global biodiversity loss,"" Mr. Moffatt said in an interview.""Many of the biggest polluters are trying to distract attention from the need to reduce emissions [through] how to offset them with a global carbon market. It is the last thing we need right now.""Canada's new federal Environment Minister, Steven Guilbeault, was arrested in 2001 during a protest against the notion that Canada could receive credits for its management of carbon sinks such as forests that absorb carbon dioxide. He compared it at the time to being rewarded ""for watching trees grow.""His B.C. counterpart, Mr. Heyman, sat down with Mr. Guilbeault during COP26 in Glasgow, but didn't push the province's forest carbon-offset program heavily in their half-hour meeting.""We didn't talk very specifically about the details of the protocol. I certainly mentioned that we were working on it,"" Mr. Heyman said in an interview.Instead, he focused on where B.C. and the federal government may work together to advance protection of forest lands.The province is in consultations with Indigenous communities about its recent proposal to suspend logging in one-third of the province's rare, old-growth forests, which are considered at a very high risk of irreversible biodiversity loss.Mr. Heyman said if those deferrals are approved, and those areas eventually turned into permanently protected lands, then those lands could be added to the carbon-offset program.Mr. Heyman, who also worked as an environmental activist prior to his political career, said he believes Mr. Guilbeault will be pragmatic about opportunities to work with B.C. on expanding forest carbon offsets.""Canada is well aware of the important role that that forests play in sequestering carbon.

253,B.C. plans to expand reforestation program to include carbon credits;Environment Minister George Heyman says a forest carbon offset program - an approach widely criticized by environmentalists - could help reduce emissions over the long term,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Breaking News from globeandmail.com,News,853,,853,Canada,Justine Hunter,,,,B.C. plans to expand reforestation program to include carbon creditsEnvironment Minister George Heyman says a forest carbon offset program - an approach widely criticized by environmentalists - could help reduce emissions over the long term,"LeadBritish Columbia's New Democratic Party government announced a reforestation milestone this week, with one billion new trees planted since taking power.Since 2018, the first planting season after the NDP formed government, the province has ramped up its tree-planting program, replacing forests that have been logged, lost to wildfires, or destroyed by mountain pine beetle infestation.Texte/TextNow the province wants to expand its program to book carbon credits for the effort - a climate-action accounting tactic that has been widely criticized by environmentalists.B.C. Environment Minister George Heyman says the 300 million seedlings planted this year will increase the carbon-capture capacity of the province's forests and reduce emissions over the long term. Heading into this month's COP26 summit on climate, his assignment was to explore opportunities to partner with the federal government to plant more trees as a way to restore lands that absorb more carbon than they emit into the atmosphere.At the same time, the province wants to widen the scope of its BC Forest Carbon Offset Protocol to expand access to its carbon-offset market so that more Indigenous communities and forest companies can turn reforestation and better forest-management activities into marketable carbon credits.B.C. doesn't count the carbon removed from the atmosphere from forest management projects in its main inventory of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Since 2007, B.C.'s GHG tally has increased by five per cent - despite more than a decade of policy changes designed to reduce emissions.It does, however, keep a separate set of books on GHG emissions that includes credit for tree planting. By that accounting, the province's GHGs have increased by only two per cent. That looks better, but only because the province does not include the GHG emissions caused by wildfires in its inventory.Canada has a rich store of natural carbon sinks, which take up some of the carbon dioxide emitted by burning fossil fuels. B.C.'s old-growth forests make up an important part of that picture, but the climate benefits are lost when those forests and other landscape features are disrupted.""We're losing our forest carbon stores in places like B.C. as a result of fires, clear-cut logging, and the other impacts of climate change,"" said Shane Moffatt, head of Greenpeace Canada's nature and food campaign. If B.C. accounted for the GHGs released into the atmosphere as a result of wildfires, the picture changes substantially: B.C.'s forests become net emitters of carbon dioxide.More importantly, he said, the trade in forest carbon offsets is being used as cover to allow polluters to continue pushing the planet closer to a climate catastrophe.""The scientific case for using forests as an excuse to keep pumping out greenhouse gas emissions would be a disaster for Canada's climate ambitions, and is no solution to global biodiversity loss,"" Mr. Moffatt said in an interview. ""Many of the biggest polluters are trying to distract attention from the need to reduce emissions [through] how to offset them with a global carbon market. It is the last thing we need right now.""Canada's new federal Environment Minister, Steven Guilbeault, was arrested in 2001 during a protest against the notion that Canada could receive credits for its management of carbon sinks such as forests that absorb carbon dioxide. He compared it at the time to being rewarded ""for watching trees grow.""His B.C. counterpart, Mr. Heyman, sat down with Mr. Guilbeault during COP26 in Glasgow, but didn't push the province's forest carbon offset program heavily in their half-hour meeting.""We didn't talk very specifically about the details of the protocol. I certainly mentioned that we were working on it,"" Mr. Heyman said in an interview.Instead, he focused on where B.C. and the federal government might work together to advance protection of forest lands.The province is in consultations with Indigenous communities about its recent proposal to suspend logging in one-third of the province's rare, old-growth forests, which are considered at a very high risk of irreversible biodiversity loss.Mr. Heyman said if those deferrals are approved, and those areas eventually turned into permanently protected lands, then those lands could be added to the carbon offset program.Mr. Heyman, who also worked as an environmental activist prior to his political career, said he believes Mr. Guilbeault will be pragmatic about opportunities to work with B.C. on expanding forest carbon offsets.""Canada is well aware of the important role that that forests play in sequestering carbon. That is at the nub of the issue of the role of forests - particularly ancient and old forests - in protecting against climate change,"" he said.

254,BORIS - IT'S TIME TO DUMP RUMPOLE OF THE CAYMANS,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday (London),News,1294,Pg. 25,1294,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,BY RICHARD LITTLEJOHN,,TALLGRASS ENERGY CORP,TALLGRASS ENERGY CORP,BORIS - IT'S TIME TO DUMP RUMPOLE OF THE CAYMANS,"Events, dear boy, etc. There comes a moment in every Prime Minister's tenure when the real world rises up and bites them on the backside.Life doesn't always read the script. The best-laid plans and so on, and so on, and scooby dooby dooby.Tony Blair's state visit to Japan in 2003 was turned upside down when he got off the plane in Tokyo to learn that Dr David Kelly, Britain's Iraq Weapons of Mass Destruction inspector, had been found dead with his wrists slashed in an Oxfordshire forest.At his subsequent set-piece press conference with the Japanese PM, the Boys In The Bubble weren't the slightest bit interested in discussing Anglo-Nippon relations. All they wanted to know was whether Blair had blood on his hands.During the 2010 election campaign, Gordon Brown turned up on Jeremy Vine's excellent Radio 2 lunchtime show to talk about how he'd saved the world from financial meltdown, only to be ambushed with a recording of his bigoted woman' remarks directed at Rochdale pensioner Gillian Duffy, who had confronted him over immigration.In similar vein, Boris Johnson returned to Glasgow this week with every intention of delivering a triumphant bulletin on the progress made at Cop26 in the battle against global warming.The hacks on the spot had other ideas. Tell us about Geoffrey Cox, the former Tory Attorney General who has trousered more than five million quid working as a lawyer while he was supposed to be an MP.What was Cox doing in the British Virgin Islands during the Covid lockdown?Er, sorry chaps, I've got a train to catch, said Boris. Everybody back in the buffet car.At least this time Boris took the rattler, rather than chartering a private plane. But scuttling away from scrutiny was not a good look. Nor did it do him any favours lingering furtively on the concourse at King's Cross station earlier in the week to avoid having to face the Commons over the Owen Paterson scandal.Sticking up for your mates is commendable. Defending the indefensible is not.Paterson was bang to rights and should have been made to walk the plank sooner. As for Cox, where do we start? Since 2009, he's spent an astonishing 10,700 hours moonlighting from the House.During Covid, he was to be found living the Death In Paradise dream, working on a Caribbean government corruption inquiry. It's one thing topping up your Parliamentary salary with the odd speech or newspaper column, provided it doesn't interfere with the day job. It's quite another filling your boots with lucrative refreshers in a Cayman Islands courtroom.Hilariously, Cox is reported to have grumbled that the 18 months or so he spent as Attorney General under Mother Theresa actually cost him money, despite pocketing a salary of around £150,000 a year.That might be chicken-feed in the legal world, but it's a king's ransom to most voters in the Red/Blue Wall who put the Tories into office with a thumping 80-seat majority.So, too, is the £500,000 Owen Paterson banked working as a consultant on top of his MP's wages.Look, if Cox wants to play at being Rumpole of the Caymans, good luck to him. But he can't do it while drawing a parliamentary salary at the same time.And this is where it gets really grubby. It transpires that Cox is also renting out his London home while claiming £1,900 a month from taxpayers for a second property. He even claimed £3,800 while he was in the West Indies.For an allegedly bright barrister, how stupid is he? He's been around Westminster long enough to know that perception is all.Claiming for one property, while renting out another takes us straight back to the expenses scandal of 2009. We're talking Jackboots Jacqui Smith here, the former Labour home secretary and MP for Redditch who tried to pretend that her sister's spare bedroom in South London was her main residence'.Some honourable members' went to prison after their various scams were exposed. That should have been a warning to them all.How long before we discover that Cox has been claiming for a duck house and moat cleaning?Boris is, of course, no stranger himself to creative accounting what we used to call in Fleet Street Old Spanish Customs'. No matter how much he earns, he always seems to be a shilling short of balancing the books. The cost of refurbishing the Carrie Cave in Downing Street, revealed by our own Simon Walters, is still under investigation.Owen Paterson's persecutor, standards gauleiter Kathryn Stone, is currently sticking her nose into Boris's holiday at Zac Goldsmith's drum in Marbella.Frankly, most of us couldn't give a monkey's if Boris stays with an old friend. It's not like Tony and Cherie Blair turning up on Cliff Richard's doorstep or freeloading off Silvio Berlusconi or one of the Bee Gees.What does cut through, however, is the stench of what we have learned to call Tory sleaze', the idea that the rules don't apply to them.Cox has legitimate questions to answer. Not least: Is he really only 61? In which case there's hope for us all. But Boris should pull the rug from under him, right now.Some of us have supported BoJo since he ran for London mayor and saved us from the Red Ken terror. He battered Corbyn and Got Brexit Done, after a fashion.So he enjoys a residue of goodwill, even in those Northern seats where the natives are getting restless.He has an uncanny ability to paint himself into a corner and walk out over the paint. But there is a growing feeling that he may be reaching the tipping point where even his most trenchant backers decide he has delighted us too long.It's instructive that his fiercest critics lately have been proper Conservatives, whose patience he has exhausted.There's mutiny in the ranks, too, as evidenced yesterday when his Chancellor, the ultra-ambitious Rishi Sunak, put the boot in on the wireless.Prime ministers always find themselves in trouble when the lower orders are no longer frightened to rebel. It's blood-letting time, Bojo. Starting with Cox and maybe even Sunak, pour encourager les autres.Stop the greenwash posturing, the pseudo-socialist, tax-hiking, big statism and remember why you went into politics in the first place, as a free-booting libertarian.At the moment, Boris is dancing in the dark. It's time he took charge of, rather than cowering in the face of, events, dear boy, events. Right now, it's his backside on the line.     A cornucopia of creepy-crawly stuff for Gary to get his teeth into today.At Cop26 they've been banging on about cutting down on meat because of the methane created by cows.Turns out they're well wide of the mark. It's caterpillars, not cattle, pumping out the poisonous gases. Scientists at Cambridge University say that gypsy moths and forest tent caterpillar moths are responsible for creating more nitrogen-rich CO2 emissions than cows.I like the sound of forest tent caterpillars right up there with our old faves the depressed river mussel and the oak processionary moths.Apparently, they munch through so many leaves that they produce vast amounts of excrement, causing defoliator outbreaks' to be released from lakes. We're talking dissolved carbon' here. As Eric Morecambe used to say: There's no answer to that!And I haven't even mentioned the spurdog and starry-smooth-hound sharks which have just turned up in the River Thames.Fill yer boots, Gary!    THE LOOKALIKELY LASSAmanda Staveley, the woman fronting for the Saudis at Newcastle United, has finally got her man. Ex-Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe has agreed to take the poisoned chalice at whatever St James's Park calls itself these days.Mail reader Dave Smith writes from Marske-by-the-Sea, Redcar, to say: I wondered who Amanda Staveley reminds me of . . . and then I realised!'She's the spitting image of the Cowardly Lion from The Wizard Of Oz.Howay the lads!© Daily Mail",Copyright 2021 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

260,"China-US pact lifts climate talks, revives vital partnership","November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Straits Times (Singapore),News,745,THE BIG STORY,745,"Singapore, Republic of",David Fogarty,,,,"China-US pact lifts climate talks, revives vital partnership","The surprise cooperation pact announced on Wednesday between the United States and China will give the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow a much-needed lift and spur global action on cutting emissions this decade, which is vital to prevent the world from heating up to dangerous levels. China and the US are the world's top two greenhouse gas emitters, producing about 40 per cent of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. ""This is a big deal. One of the big fears going into Glasgow was that China and the US would be at loggerheads, but in fact, what this statement says is that they will collaborate, despite their differences,"" said Dr Simon Bradshaw, head of research at the Climate Council, a climate science and communications group in Australia. ""The focus on accelerating action this decade is significant,"" he added. The United Nations (UN) says the world has this decade to slash CO2 emissions by nearly half, to limit global warming to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels. The pact echoes the sense of unity instrumental in creating the 2015 Paris Agreement, the world's main climate change treaty, and puts aside the rancour between both nations that marred the start of the Glasgow talks. China's special climate envoy Xie Zhenhua and his US counterpart John Kerry signed the cooperation pact at COP26. Both were critical players in the creation of the Paris Agreement. Some observers pointed to the broader significance of the deal. Mr Li Shuo, senior climate and energy policy analyst at Greenpeace East Asia, said: ""For bilateral relations, the statement paves the ground for the Biden-Xi virtual summit next week. Setting climate change aside from the more toxic bilateral issues is good for the world."" Mr Nick Mabey, chief executive of climate policy think-tank E3G, said the big significance of the pact was geopolitical, as it would put pressure on both countries to make Glasgow a success. Under the agreement, both nations agreed to step up efforts to cut emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that is produced mainly by the coal, oil and gas sectors, and agriculture. China said it would develop a national action plan on methane to achieve cuts this decade. Both nations would also cooperate on renewable energy and modernising power grids, and also step up other efforts to cut CO2. China also said it would phase down coal consumption during the second half of this decade. Both nations would meet regularly from next year to accelerate their action plans. Experts said China's pledge to cut methane is significant, given its silence so far on the issue. Georgetown University Associate Professor Joanna Lewis, an expert on US-China climate change cooperation, said non-CO2 greenhouse gases were notably absent from China's nationally determined contribution (NDC), its updated climate pledge to the UN released last month. Nor did China sign the global pledge to cut methane emissions by 30 per cent by 2030, said Prof Lewis on Twitter. More than 100 nations have signed the pledge. She said the joint declaration ""sets the stage for more movement"". ""The value here is putting several things down on paper that China has been saying in domestic plans and speeches, but had been absent from their NDC. And, of course, this can hopefully push a strong Glasgow agreement over the finish line,"" Prof Lewis added. Collective emissions cuts to date will put the world on a path to warm more than 2 deg C by the end of this century, giving rise to deadlier impacts. While the US-China statement drew wide praise, some called for more specifics. Ms Helen Mountford, vice-president of climate and economics at the Washington-based World Resources Institute, told The Straits Times in an e-mail: ""It is critical for the world's two largest emitters to take much more assertive action in this decisive decade to avoid the worsening impacts of climate change that put us all at risk, particularly the most vulnerable.

261,"China-US pact lifts climate talks, revives vital partnership","November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Straits Times (Singapore),News,745,THE BIG STORY,745,"Singapore, Republic of",David Fogarty,,,,"China-US pact lifts climate talks, revives vital partnership","The surprise cooperation pact announced on Wednesday between the United States and China will give the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow a much-needed lift and spur global action on cutting emissions this decade, which is vital to prevent the world from heating up to dangerous levels. China and the US are the world's top two greenhouse gas emitters, producing about 40 per cent of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. ""This is a big deal. One of the big fears going into Glasgow was that China and the US would be at loggerheads, but in fact, what this statement says is that they will collaborate, despite their differences,"" said Dr Simon Bradshaw, head of research at the Climate Council, a climate science and communications group in Australia. ""The focus on accelerating action this decade is significant,"" he added. The United Nations (UN) says the world has this decade to slash CO2 emissions by nearly half, to limit global warming to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels. The pact echoes the sense of unity instrumental in creating the 2015 Paris Agreement, the world's main climate change treaty, and puts aside the rancour between both nations that marred the start of the Glasgow talks. China's special climate envoy Xie Zhenhua and his US counterpart John Kerry signed the cooperation pact at COP26. Both were critical players in the creation of the Paris Agreement. Some observers pointed to the broader significance of the deal. Mr Li Shuo, senior climate and energy policy analyst at Greenpeace East Asia, said: ""For bilateral relations, the statement paves the ground for the Biden-Xi virtual summit next week. Setting climate change aside from the more toxic bilateral issues is good for the world."" Mr Nick Mabey, chief executive of climate policy think-tank E3G, said the big significance of the pact was geopolitical, as it would put pressure on both countries to make Glasgow a success. Under the agreement, both nations agreed to step up efforts to cut emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that is produced mainly by the coal, oil and gas sectors, and agriculture. China said it would develop a national action plan on methane to achieve cuts this decade. Both nations would also cooperate on renewable energy and modernising power grids, and also step up other efforts to cut CO2. China also said it would phase down coal consumption during the second half of this decade. Both nations would meet regularly from next year to accelerate their action plans. Experts said China's pledge to cut methane is significant, given its silence so far on the issue. Georgetown University Associate Professor Joanna Lewis, an expert on US-China climate change cooperation, said non-CO2 greenhouse gases were notably absent from China's nationally determined contribution (NDC), its updated climate pledge to the UN released last month. Nor did China sign the global pledge to cut methane emissions by 30 per cent by 2030, said Prof Lewis on Twitter. More than 100 nations have signed the pledge. She said the joint declaration ""sets the stage for more movement"". ""The value here is putting several things down on paper that China has been saying in domestic plans and speeches, but had been absent from their NDC. And, of course, this can hopefully push a strong Glasgow agreement over the finish line,"" Prof Lewis added. Collective emissions cuts to date will put the world on a path to warm more than 2 deg C by the end of this century, giving rise to deadlier impacts. While the US-China statement drew wide praise, some called for more specifics. Ms Helen Mountford, vice-president of climate and economics at the Washington-based World Resources Institute, told The Straits Times in an e-mail: ""It is critical for the world's two largest emitters to take much more assertive action in this decisive decade to avoid the worsening impacts of climate change that put us all at risk, particularly the most vulnerable. ""The United States and China can build on this declaration here in Glasgow by lending their support for strong outcomes in the negotiations, including calling on major emitters to come back within a couple of years to submit stronger 2030 emission reduction targets."" Mr Ma Jun, director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, a Beijing research and advocacy group, added that the pledge opens up more opportunities for economic cooperation.

263,Climate action can't be divorced from cost of living;Policymakers have to show how climate initiatives can lead to a better quality of life and higher living standards,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Irish Times,News,948,OPINION;Pg. 10,948,Ireland,Shana Cohen,,,,Climate action can't be divorced from cost of livingPolicymakers have to show how climate initiatives can lead to a better quality of life and higher living standards,"The two weeks of Cop26 are coming to a close. International agreements aimed at slowing global warming are in place but politicians still have to figure out how to make the changes in individual behaviour these plans mandate less expensive and more palatable to their citizens. It will not be easy. A recent Kantar Public Survey conducted in 10 countries showed that while most people recognised the importance of confronting the climate crisis, the majority said they could not afford to make the necessary changes in their lifestyles. They said they required more resources and equipment from their governments in order to make the changes. A recent survey in Ireland (funded by Tasc and the Foundation for European Progressive Studies) found that addressing climate change and protecting the environment are far less of a priority for the majority of voters than better healthcare and housing or reducing homelessness and crime. An Irish Times Ipsos/MRBI poll in October found a high degree of public resistance to many potential climate action measures. It was especially the case with measures which would entail increased costs for individuals. Asked if they would personally support various measures, people's resistance was highest to those measures which would directly affect people's standard of living. If households are reluctant to change their behaviour, largely because of the economic impact on their standard of living, it does not bode well for the promises being made at Cop26 or the ambitious ""Green deals"" previously announced by the US and EU, not to mention Ireland's Climate Action Plan. These plans all highlight investment in renewable energy, recycling, transport, retrofitting and energy efficiency, biodiversity and relevant training. However, the gains from these policies are invariably too vague and far-off to justify the costs involved for households already struggling to make ends meet.Contradiction Even those households able to absorb the impact of the measures may not perceive any tangible benefit from doing so. The Climate Action Plan aims to insulate 500,000 homes by 2030 at a cost of EUR 28 billion, or EUR 56,000 per home. The Government has committed EUR 8.7 billion towards retrofitting houses with insulation. The grants are targeted in particular at low-income families otherwise unable to afford retrofitting. But middle-income families will probably not benefit enough from the investment in retrofitting to make it worth their while. Similarly, landlords may decide not to pay for expensive materials and labour costs when it's the tenants receiving the energy bills .The problem is being further complicated by the rising cost of living, globally as well as here in Ireland. Over the past 12 months, prices here have risen by 5.1 per cent, according to the latest consumer price index from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) - the largest increase recorded in 14 years. Increasing fuel and electricity costs are driving up energy bills, weighing further on families who may already be struggling because of the economic fallout of the pandemic. How then can the Irish and other governments resolve the contradiction of needing households to spend money on retrofitting or electric cars to meet emissions targets when it's difficult for those same households just to stay afloat?There is a political imperative for them to find a solution. The consequence of implementing climate policy - especially punitive measures like a carbon tax and culling cattle herds - without being fully attuned to the impact on the standard of living of voters will be diminishing public trust in the policymakers themselves. Declining trust in policymaking, as we have witnessed far too much over the past five years, boosts the appeal of ""outsider"" populist politicians. They will deny the scale of climate destruction while calling for job creation and economic growth to supersede any climate action. TD Michael Healy-Rae went some of the way down this road when he accused the Green Party last week of knowing ""nothing about job creation, nothing about work, nothing about how the country keeps rolling"". American senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia has used the same argument, blocking Joe Biden's climate change legislation because of his state's economic reliance on coal mining.Policymakers have to show the public how climate change initiatives can lead to a better quality of life and higher standards of living. Doing so would entail dramatically expanding public knowledge of how climate change exacerbates daily financial strains; the very issues that people are prioritising such as paying for health conditions related to issues like pollution and diet or rising energy bills because of poor insulation and prolonged weather events like storms. The approach also means prioritising investments in areas like community health, which have a direct impact on individuals and their families. The Government could highlight the climate and health benefits of shopping locally for food while providing financial incentives for local food shops, especially in neighbourhoods of high deprivation, to offer a healthy, affordable selection. Pursuing one of the objectives of the EU Green Deal, the Government could support the development and delivery of local training programmes in recycling computers, clothes, appliances and other goods to create jobs and lower costs. These may seem like minor measures in comparison to the lofty discussions in Glasgow, but they offer visible, concrete and practical evidence of the relationship between a better life and climate action.

The action came shortly after another scientist from the group sailed down the  River Clyde in a rubber  dinghy.He clutched a sign that read ""tell the truth or we will lose everything"" before he was stopped by coast guards. Mike Lynch-White, Scientist Rebellion co-founder, said: ""Fossil fuel companies, like Scottish Power, are committing crimes against humanity for profit. They're murdering our children so their already too wealthy shareholders can get even wealthier. Words cannot describe this level of evil."" Kyle Topfer, Scientist Rebellion activist, added: ""Greenwashing by smaller subsidiaries is hiding the fact that their parent companies are annihilating indigenous nations and future generations through deceit, deception, delay, dishonesty and direct exploitation.""

270,Developing countries dig in heels as talks reach final lap,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Hindustan Times Mumbai,News,291,,291,"India, Republic of",,,,,Developing countries dig in heels as talks reach final lap,"Glasgow, Nov. 12 -- Talks at the 26th edition of the climate change conference (COP26) in Glasgow entered the crucial final stages of negotiations, with a key grouping of developing countries, which includes India and China, raising objections against some segments of the draft proposal, decrying what they said would amount to ""carbon colonialism"" by rich nations.Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) said the draft document on the outcome of the summit - particularly its focus on the 1.5degC target for all countries -- is reinventing the terms of the 2015 Paris Agreement, which made a differentiation in climate action and ambition. ""The Paris Agreement has a delicate balance which we cannot rewrite. There should be differentiation in climate action and ambition. There should also be recognition of the pre-2020 ambition gap. If we go ahead with the proposal of net-zero by 2050 for all countries, the developing world will be trapped. We do not have the technological and financial means to achieve such targets. Developing countries will be ethically and financially condemned for not complying,"" said Diego Pacheco, lead negotiator of Bolivia on behalf of LMDC.Pacheco added 60% of the carbon space was occupied by developed countries with only 18% of the world population, and that the historical responsibility of these regions in causing the climate crisis cannot be ignored. They instead proposed to the COP26 presidency that there be recognition of this historical responsibility and the limited carbon space in the final deal.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from HT Mumbai.

271,Doctor diagnoses 'climate change',"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Herald (Glasgow),News,457,Pg. 15,457,Scotland,F L-Maureen Sugden ,,,,Doctor diagnoses 'climate change',"CLIMATE change has been the main focus of discourse in recent days at COP26, but it has now emerged that a patient has become the first in the world to be diagnosed with ""climate change"".Diagnosed?Canadian doctor Kyle Merritt made the diagnosis of his 70-year-old female patient in what is believed to be a world first, writing on her medical notes that ""the underlying cause"" of her health issues is ""climate change"".How can this be?Dr Merritt - who works in the emergency department at Kootenay Lake Hospital in Nelson, British Columbia - said that he reached his findings following a recent heatwave, which, along with the resulting poor air quality, he believed contributed to his patient's failing health.How bad were the conditions?Between June 25 and July 1 in British Columbia, a heatwave became the deadliest weather event in Canadian history. Official figures found nearly 600 people died amid the conditions that saw Canada's heat records broken when the mercury hit 49.6C on June 29 in the village of Lytton. A resulting wildfire destroyed the community. It was one of dozens that broke out, with the thick smoke causing air quality to plunge to levels 43 times worse than normal.The doctor linked the two?Dr Merritt said his patient's existing conditions were impacted severely. He said: ""She has diabetes. She has some heart failure ... she lives in a trailer, no air conditioning. All of her health problems have all been worsened. And she's really struggling to stay hydrated."" He added: ""If we're not looking at the underlying cause, and we're just treating the symptoms, we're just gonna keep falling further and further behind.""His peers shared his view?His colleagues agreed and he set about forming an internal group of about 40 medical professionals called ""Doctors and Nurses for Planetary Health"". In a statement on its website, the group says: ""As physicians and nurses, we saw first-hand the physical and mental effects of climate change on our patients and communities. We see this as a looming disaster that risks undermining our already overburdened medical system.""It comes as ...?Climate change is the key talking point at the COP26 summit in Glasgow where countries are being called on to reach net zero by the middle of the century.However?Critics say efforts do not go far enough to stave off the looming crisis. The World Health Organisation states: ""Climate change is the single biggest health threat facing humanity and health professionals worldwide are already responding to the health harms caused by this unfolding crisis."" It predicts that between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250 000 additional deaths per year, from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress.",Copyright 2021 Newsquest Media Group All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|HER|ENGLISH|educationwales_communitywales electoral wardhealth terms|EXTREME TEMPERATURESHEAT WAVESAIR QUALITYCLIMATE CHANGEHEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALSMEDICINE & HEALTHNURSES & NURSINGPROFESSIONAL WORKERSSEVERE WEATHERASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONSDEATH & DYINGEMERGENCY ROOMSHEALTH DEPARTMENTSPHYSICIANS & SURGEONSHEAT STRESS DISORDERSWEATHERDIABETESMALARIAMALNUTRITIONDEATH RATESFIRESWILDFIRESPUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATIONELECTORAL DISTRICTS|HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALSNURSES & NURSINGEMERGENCY ROOMSHEALTH DEPARTMENTSPHYSICIANS & SURGEONS|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA|CANADAWALES",

Holyrood\xE2s Ministry of Truth pre-festive peddling of fear, uncertainty, and distortion of facts over Covid is underway.The nightmares before Christmas have well and truly started, with our doom-mongering Grinch, Deputy First Minister John Swinney, terrifying and tenderising our divided nation in the Scottish Parliament with apocalyptic visions of Covid calamities to come. He warned that, as a pre-emptive measure to Save Christmas, the Scottish Government are considering extending their highly contentious, business-bursting vaccine passports to pubs, restaurants, cafes, and leisure venues.He said: \xE2We need to take appropriate measures to keep the pandemic under control...it is because we want to avoid more difficult restrictions that we cannot rule out strengthening the baseline measures currently in place as the best way to head off any prospect of future lockdowns...we have been considering for example whether we may need to extend the Covid certification scheme to bring more settings into scope, such as indoor hospitality and leisure settings.\xE2READ MORE:\xC2The stench of sleaze and second jobsIn other words, a total roll-out of this discriminatory scheme. This is something we had previously been assured would not happen and comes straight off the back of his shocking admission at last week\xE2s cross party Covid-19 Committee that his government cannot produce any evidence to support the introduction of vaccination passports or prove that they reduce the spread of coronavirus.Incredibly, he stated that it is, \xE2impossible to segment data to determine if it is working\xE2 but that he ""believes"" it is delivering a positive benefit, which prompted a hilarious response from astonished Lib-Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton who inquired, \xE2if he said there were fairies at the bottom of the garden would we not be expected to ask for evidence?\xE2The Scottish Government are now guilty of making policies up on the hoof, mandatory rules which curtail our freedoms and restrict our movements on an ill-informed hunch. They cannot produce any evidence to support this iniquitous and discriminatory measure because quite simply there isn\xE2t any to be had.There is, however, plenty of tangible evidence available, if they only cared to look, that shows the catastrophic impact vaccine passports have already had on the ailing night-time economy and live music industry. Some desperate operators and venues are reporting a gut-wrenching drop in footfall of up to 60% and no shows hovering around the 25% mark. Not the cynical and misleading figures of 10-20% that our pumped-up, unelected public health pixie Jason Leitch has been banding about.There is an abundance of data which supports claims that as a public health measure vaccination passports are useless; they don\xE2t save lives and do nothing to stop the virus from spreading. The medical journal The Lancet recently reported that fully vaccinated individuals with infections have peak viral loads similar to unvaccinated cases and can easily transmit infection.Yet here we are again being warned by our \xE2have a hunch\xE2 Covid Recovery Cabinet Secretary, oh the irony, that he has reasons to suspect cases will rise, not least because of an influx of visitors during COP26, an event which should have been rescheduled if deemed a public health hazard.Swinney said that in order to Save our Christmas and our badly resourced NHS, which was needing saving long before Covid, stricter rules for face coverings as well as a wider use of the discredited vaccine passport scheme might come into force. In Swinney newspeak, this means they will.These crippling measures could decimate Scotland\xE2s wider hospitality and retail sectors and as Dr Liz Cameron of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce warned \xE2risk derailing our economic growth\xE2.READ MORE:\xC2\xC2Sturgeon confirms Scotland 'considering joining' alliance to end oil and gas useA discredited scheme which our FM Nicola Sturgeon once said she would not support because it deepened social inequalities and took away people\xE2s liberties.

273,Ending coal-fired power stations is key to COP - David Young,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Scotsman,News,481,BUSINESS,481,Scotland,,,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANKPINSENT MASONS LLP,Ending coal-fired power stations is key to COP - David Young,"More than 40 countries have committed to phasing out  coal-fired power station s, a vitally important initiative to limit global heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. But how will governments and financial institutions deliver on these commitments and what will they need to do to facilitate the decommissioning and closing of plants?Pinsent Masons is helping nations navigate these challenges. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) announced at COP26 that it has appointed the firm to advise on a feasibility study to phase out coal-fired power plants across South East Asia.The establishment of an Energy Transition Mechanism (ETM) will accelerate the retirement of coal-fired power plants, allowing countries to switch to renewables energies. It is projected to be significant both from a regional and global perspective and could result in savings of 2Gt of carbon emissions, the equivalent of removing more than 55 million passenger cars from the road or planting over 2 billion trees (covering an area half the size of Scotland).The first phase will look to structure the ETM and provide a financial incentive to help accelerate the retirement of coal-fired power plants in Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines. The study will identify ways to acquire assets, how to deal with the plants when they are retired, restoration requirements and how carbon credits may be used. In the absence of a tailored ETM, the chances of achieving net zero within the required timeline are significantly reduced.A Pinsent Masons team led by Hong Kong-based energy partner John Yeap, Ian Warner in London and myself in Edinburgh, will provide specialist legal funds and structuring advice to ADB, as well as advice on energy regulatory and decommissioning considerations.Through supporting ADB, we are delighted to play a role in delivering not just on meaningful carbon abatement, but also ensuring a just transition for all stakeholders, including communities that will be impacted by it. Collaborating with other advisers, including KPMG and Mott McDonald, we will deliver to ADB a solution that is financially robust, but also meets complex and strict energy regulatory considerations regardless of where in Asia the plant is located.The ETM has the potential to provide a valuable blueprint for other countries who will also be looking at overhauling their fossil fuel industries as the world comes together to tackle the climate crisis. The scheme draws on global financial, technical and legal experience in analogous matters and repurposes that expertise to create this blueprint.As a Scottish based lawyer, it’s a privilege to be part of a team working on an international project - one of the biggest climate commitments to date - with real potential to have a material impact in reducing emissionsDavid Young, partner and asset management and investment fund specialist at Pinsent Masons",Copyright 2021 JPIMedia Publishing Ltd All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANKPINSENT MASONS LLP|ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK|NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKINGSIC6081 BRANCHES & AGENCIES OF FOREIGN BANKSNAICS541110 OFFICES OF LAWYERSSIC8111 LEGAL SERVICES|ATB (ASX)|DEVELOPMENT BANKSEMISSIONSENERGY & UTILITY POLICYCLIMATE CHANGECLOSINGSINTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCENEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSENERGY & UTILITY LAWCARBON OFFSETSGREENHOUSE GASESAPPOINTMENTSEMISSIONS CREDITSINTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS|ENERGY & UTILITIESCOAL FIRED PLANTSELECTRIC POWER PLANTSDEVELOPMENT BANKSFOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTSEMISSIONSENERGY & UTILITY POLICYALTERNATIVE & RENEWABLE ENERGYENERGY & UTILITY REGULATION & POLICYBANKING & FINANCEENERGY & UTILITY LAWCARBON OFFSETSPUBLISHINGEMISSIONS CREDITSMOTOR VEHICLES|LONDON, ENGLANDEDINBURGH, SCOTLANDGLASGOW, SCOTLAND|ASIASCOTLANDHONG KONGINDONESIAPHILIPPINESSOUTH-EASTERN ASIA",ATB (ASX)

We've got to have decisive action, stop the use of fossil fuels and move to renewables.""We don't think the government currently up in Glasgow are up to the task.""It's our responsibility out on the streets to make sure that there is real change and this change is going to come from the common people.""Much of Lowestoft and East Anglia could be underwater in the future if action is not taken now.""The local council has taken a position for positive change but we need that real investment from government for renewable alternative jobs.""World leaders at COP26 have so far pledged to end deforestation by 2030, cut methane emissions and more than 40 countries have agreed to phase out coal and fossil fuel production.But Richard Chilvers, Waveney TUC secretary and protest organiser, said demonstrations like these will continue until complete action is agreed upon.""This is the first of many protests,"" he said.""We need this kind of people pressure to change things.""The statements that have been made are greenwashing and I fully support Greta Thunberg with her 'blah blah blah' message.""Extinction Rebellion protester Kate was speaking on behalf of green councillor for Suffolk Coastal Rachel Smith-Lyte.The campaigner, who didn't give her surname, said: ""Rachel is in Glasgow and has said these talks are likely to fail.""This is the beginning of a new struggle, where it is up to us ordinary people to create the change.""There a tough decisions to be made in the future and this will include making everyday changes to our lives and holding government words to account so they take action.""",Copyright 2021 Archant Regional Limited All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|LOW|ENGLISH|JK COP26 lowie protest|PROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONSNEGATIVE MISC NEWSNEGATIVE NEWSREGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTSCLIMATE CHANGENEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSPOLITICSGREENWASHINGGREENHOUSE GASESDEFORESTATIONGREEN DEALSPOLITICAL ORGANIZATIONSASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONSPOLITICAL PARTIESEMISSIONS|ENERGY & UTILITIESGREENWASHINGMETHANENATURAL GASDEFORESTATIONGREEN DEALSEMISSIONS|GRETA THUNBERG|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND",
275,Facebook accused of profiting from misinformation about climate crisis,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),News,1052,"CLIMATE,NEWS;Version:1",1052,England & Wales,Hebe Campbell,,FACEBOOK INC,FACEBOOK INC,Facebook accused of profiting from misinformation about climate crisis,"A new report claims Facebook is profiting from fake news about the climate emergency at the same time that thousands are at the Cop26 summit to discuss urgent action to protect the planet. Campaign groups Stop Funding Heat and The Real Facebook Oversight Board said that Facebook is accepting paid-for adverts on the social network that are pushing fake news about climate change and facilitating the spread of misinformation. These posts, the campaign groups claim, are receiving more than a million daily views of this kind of content. It comes at a bad time for Facebook and its new parent company Meta, the launch of which was overshadowed by whistleblower Francis Haugen's claims that the company is actively prioritising profit over user safety. The former product manager urged Mark Zuckerberg to step down as company chief as she addressed MPs, saying the company could be stronger with someone willing to focus on user safety at the helm.Based on what Facebook itself classifies as climate misinformation, Stop Funding Heat's report found that there are between 818,000 and 1.36 million daily views of climate misinformation on the platform.It also found that just 3.6 per cent of fake posts about climate change had a ""fact-checking label"", something Facebook uses to mark content that is deemed by their third-party fact-checkers as misinformation. Only 10.7 per cent of these posts were directing users to Facebook's Climate Science Centre, a page created to counteract this kind of content. The Climate Science Centre directs users who are reading misleading posts about the climate to credible information.Facebook has questioned the accuracy of the figures in the report and said the campaign groups used ""flawed methodology"".The company announced earlier this month the platform is rolling out the Climate Science Centre to 100 more countries and will be applying the informational labels to more posts to fight the spread of misinformation. It also said comparing estimates on impressions to daily Climate Science Centre visitors is ""apples to oranges"", as content impressions happen on users' news feeds and in pages and groups while people generally click into the Climate Science Centre.Sean Buchan, chief researcher at Stop Funding Heat, said the spread of misinformation on the climate crisis can lead to ""real-world changes in attitudes"". He said: ""Hundreds of thousands are already dying every year from the impacts of climate change. Academic research has shown that climate misinformation, wherever consumed, leads to real-world changes in attitudes, including changes in acceptance of climate change science, changes in behaviour regarding its urgency, and even changes in stance on policies.""The report claims that Facebook is taking thousands of pounds from paid-for adverts sharing climate misinformation. It said that 76 per cent of the accounts found to be sharing false information had been flagged to Facebook in October 2020 by InfluenceMap, an independent think tank sharing data and analysis on how business and finance are affecting the climate crisis.It found adverts on Facebook's advertising platform that included phrases like ""climate change is a HOAX"" and ""environmentalism... is tantamount to religion"". It is estimated that between 11.7 million to 14.1 million people had viewed these adverts per year.Some 113 of these adverts including climate misinformation were identified from 1 January to 17 October this year, with most of the adverts predominantly shown in the UK, North America and Australia.Using Facebook's own numbers, these adverts amounted to an estimated revenue for the platform of around $75,000 and are estimated to have had over 10 million views. More than 90 per cent of the adverts had a disclaimer but none of the adverts were fact-checked or taken down by Facebook. When approached, Facebook said they pause all adverts from advertisers who repeatedly share fact-checked content.They also said all climate-related adverts that are permitted to run are included in the public Ad Library for anyone to scrutinise, which gives it more transparency than the adverts received when they run on television or in newspapers.The report is not the first time Facebook has been accused of propagating climate misinformation through its platform -clothing brand Patagonia announced it had pulled all of its paid advertising on the social media platform in June 2020 due to ""the spread of hate speech and misinformation about climate change"". Last week the company said they continue to stand by the boycott. The company wrote: ""The internal Facebook documents released over the last few weeks have made it incredibly clear that they know the irreparable damage that their lack of accountability causes their three billion users and the corrosive effects that has on society itself.""We encourage other businesses to join us in pushing Facebook to prioritise people and the planet over profit.""The release of the report coincides with the meeting of world leaders in Glasgow to debate the measures needed to safeguard the future at the Cop26 climate summit. Mr Buchan added that Facebook ""continues to downplay or totally ignores"" the issue of climate change misinformation on its platforms ""whenever new evidence using their own data and tools is presented to them"". He said: ""Facebook need to take leadership on this issue before their growing climate misinformation problem becomes the next accidental Q-Anon, or worse.""A spokesperson from Facebook said: ""This report uses made-up numbers and a flawed methodology to suggest content on Facebook is misinformation when it's really just posts these groups disagree with politically. ""In fact, there were over 140 million interactions with climate change content overall during the same time frame -more than 14 times the interactions this report claims.""

281,First Thing: Trump wins stay on release of key White House records,"November 12, 2021 Friday",Non-jurisdictional,The Guardian (London),News,1276,US NEWS;Version:1,1276,,Clea Skopeliti,,,,First Thing: Trump wins stay on release of key White House records,"Good morning.Donald Trump has succeeded in an 11th-hour attempt to temporarily stay  the release of sensitive White House records on the US Capitol attack.Washington DC's federal appeals court on Thursday granted Trump's request to temporarily stop the National Archives from handing over the records to the bipartisan House select committee that is investigating the 6 January insurrection.After the US district judge Tanya Chutkan's ruling that the former president could not claim executive privilege over the documents, Trump was granted a temporary injunction.                                                                                        What is Trump doing? Delaying. The Democrat-led committee may have to finish its investigation before next year's midterms, in which Republicans are tipped to take control of the US House.                                                                                          When is the hearing? The court will hear oral arguments on 30 November.                                                                                          Who are the judges? The DC circuit court chooses three judges at random to consider the appeal: it will be Patricia Millett, Robert Wilkins and Ketanji Brown Jackson.                                                           US fails to sign up to Cop26's boldest pledges                   The US has failed to commit  to some of Cop26's toughest climate pledges, with its signature noticeably absent on promises to phase out coalmining, to end the use of internal combustion engines and to compensate poorer countries.This is despite the Biden administration proclaiming the US's status as a climate leader and underlining its willingness to undo the damage caused by the previous administration. It comes as Democrats express confidence that their pared-down $1.75tn spending bill, which contains landmark climate measures, will clear Congress next week.The weakness of the proposed targets agreed at the climate summit means leaders will have to renegotiate next year , the three architects of the Paris agreement said. Current national plans would lead to 2.4C of heating , according to analysis by Climate Action Tracker - a far cry from 1.5C.                                                                                        How many committed to phasing out coalmining? More than 40 countries signed up to the pledge, excluding the US, China and India. The latter two combined burn about two-thirds of the world's coal, and the US still generates about a fifth of its electricity from it.                                                                                          Meanwhile, delegates from countries where the climate emergency is already ""an everyday reality"" have spoken about how  they are affected by anxiety over the looming disaster.                                                           These maps show how Republicans are blatantly rigging elections                   Before next year's midterms, politicians are undertaking the once-a-decade process of editing the nation's political maps: the ""invisible scalpel"" known as gerrymandering that shapes the terrain and tenor of US politics.The US is almost unique in allowing partisan lawmakers to redraw maps for their own advantage. This year Republicans can redraw the lines of 187 congressional districts, while Democrats can do so in 75.Here are four maps showing the key ways  that Republicans will seek to increase their chances of winning back the US House next November:                                                               Dismantling a Democratic district.                                                                 Diluting the influence of Black voters.                                                                 Weakening diverse suburbs.                                                                 Regrouping Democrats voters into non-competitive districts.

The judge presiding over Kyle Rittenhouse's homicide trial has been thrust into the spotlight after he admonished prosecutors and his phone was heard ringing with a song  played at Donald Trump's rallies. Wisconsin's longest-serving circuit judge, Bruce Schroeder, also queried the veracity of iPad footage ahead of the defense resting its case.                                                                                          Netflix has cut a Latina housekeeper character                         from its upcoming series Uncoupled, starring Neil Patrick Harris, after a veteran actor described the characterization as ""hurtful and derogatory"".  Ada Maris wrote an open letter expressing offense at the stereotypes reinforced by the role.                                                                                          The US and European delegations on the UN security council have called for action against Belarus,                         condemning Minsk for endangering migrants  ""for political purposes"". Poland says Belarus has lured 2,000 migrants in order to send them over its border in revenge for EU sanctions.                                                                                          The American journalist Danny Fenster has been jailed for 11 years in Myanmar  after being convicted on a range of charges  previously described by the US government as ""profoundly unjust"".                                                           Stat of the day: AstraZeneca has sold more than $2.2bn of Covid vaccine this year                   AstraZeneca is set to move to ""modest profitability"" after selling more than $2.2bn of its Covid-19 vaccine  in the first nine months of this year. The drugmaker has committed to providing the shot on a not-for-profit basis during the pandemic so far, and sales in the year's final three months ""are expected to be a blend of the original pandemic agreements and new orders"", it said.                   Don't miss this: Placebo talk gender fluidity, queerness and climate apocalypse                   Twenty-five years on from their debut album, Placebo are back. On the band's eighth studio album, singer Brian Molko - who ""cultivated a gendered and sexual expansiveness"" decades before the term ""non-binary"" became commonly used - turns his attention to climate disaster and surveillance culture. Bleak as that may sound, co-writer and multi-instrumentalist Stefan Olsdal reflects on Never Let Me Go's exploration of the theme of ""love in the time of cholera"". Or, as Sasha Geffen puts it , ""how we hold each other through the ruin"".                   Last Thing: Merkel's star doppelganger steps down alongside chancellor                   Germany's leading Angela Merkel impersonator , Ursula Wanecki, is pretty much the chancellor's spitting image. But after 16 years as Merkel's double, Wanecki says she will hang up the blazers when the 67-year-old retires next month. The lookalike doesn't expect people will stop shouting ""hallo Angie"" at her ""for some time to come"" though.

283,FM talking to fossil fuel abolitionists about joining,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Evening Express,News,509,NEWS;Pg. 17,509,England & Wales,RACHEL AMERY,,,,FM talking to fossil fuel abolitionists about joining,"NICOLA Sturgeon is in ""active discussion"" to join a group committed to stopping oil and gas production.The first minister said Scotland is likely to join the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, a coalition set up by Denmark and Costa Rica which commits its core members to halting new drilling for fossil fuels.There are different categories of membership, but the move has inevitably raised jobs fears.The comments came after Friends of the Earth Scotland criticised Ms Sturgeon for spending time on photo stunts at COP26.Reacting, Ms Sturgeon said she wants to end Scotland's reliance on fossil fuels ""as fast as possible"".But it needs to be done without putting oil and gas workers ""on the economic scrapheap"".She said: ""We're actually in active discussions with (the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance) about joining.""But there are different categories of membership and therefore we're going through an assessment as to what category - if we did choose to join - would best suit our circumstances.""Ms Sturgeon added: ""I would expect us, over the next period, to associate ourselves in one of those categories of membership.""It's not the easiest message for a country like Scotland that has a long history and a big oil and gas sector to say that we must, to use the terminology of the organisation, move beyond oil and gas.""We must do that as quickly as possible. But for somebody like me, stating that is the easy bit.""We've got to do that in a way that is as fast as possible but in a way that doesn't simply increase our dependence on imported oil and gas and, crucially, doesn't leave the 100,000 people currently working in oil and gas on the economic scrapheap.""Ms Sturgeon was photographed with activist Greta Thunberg and other campaigners and world leaders at COP26.Richard Dixon, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, earlier demanded more action than talk.He said: ""Nicola Sturgeon is keen to use the language of climate justice and be photographed with Greta Thunberg but at some point her fine rhetoric has to translate into a commitment to stopping the oil and gas production that is driving the climate crisis.""North East Tory MSP Liam Kerr said: ""This is an admission that the SNP-Green government are abandoning Scotland's oil and gas industry.""Workers in Scotland's oil and gas industry will be dismayed.""He added: ""Beyond Oil and Gas are committed to a dramatic shift away from fossil fuels.""By opening discussions with them, Nicola Sturgeon is signalling her intent to put thousands of Scottish jobs on a cliff edge.""Spurred on by her anti-business Green coalition partners, the first minister's actions threaten livelihoods in communities across the north-east of Scotland.""Workers in Scotland's oil and gas industry will be dismayed by the SNP-Green coalition's actions, and will rightly question the government's promise of a fair transition.""There are three categories of Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance membership.

288,Friday briefing: PM's new headache as Patel bully case goes to court,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Guardian (London),News,2116,WORLD NEWS;Version:1,2116,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Warren Murray,,FOOD & DRUG ADMINISTRATION,FOOD & DRUG ADMINISTRATION,Friday briefing: PM's new headache as Patel bully case goes to court,"                   Top story: Football jibe rebounds at second-job MP                   Hello, I'm Warren Murray and I know it's Friday but there is still a bit to get through, so let us begin.The government faces a legal challenge to Boris Johnson's decision to back Priti Patel over bullying allegations, throwing a fresh spotlight on the prime minister's approach to ethics in public life. Alex Allan, Johnson's independent adviser on the ministerial code, resigned last year after the prime minister chose not to act, following a Cabinet Office investigation citing instances in which Patel had shouted and sworn at staff. The FDA union of senior civil servants has brought a judicial review of the PM's decision.  It will be heard next week.Natalie Elphicke - the Tory MP for Dover who suggested Marcus Rashford should stick to football instead of campaigning about free school meals - has a second job herself, which she has revealed on her register of interests. Elphicke, who earns £82,000 as an MP, also gets £36,000 a year  from her role as chair of the New Homes Quality Board, ""an industry-led initiative to promote a new code for housebuilding standards together with a structure for an independent New Homes ombudsman"". The Guardian has approached Elphicke for comment.It has emerged that the Conservative MP Geoffrey Cox has agreed to an additional two weeks of work representing ministers from the British Virgin Islands this month while parliament is sitting. Government ministers have pointedly refused to defend Cox against allegations that he has been putting lucrative outside work ahead of his duties to his constituents  - something he has denied. Cox says a legal team will perform most of the work and he will only be required to appear for two hours during the period. Cox also makes money by renting out a three-bedroom flat overlooking Battersea Park in south London, which was bought in 2004, partly using taxpayer payments towards mortgage interest costs under the old system of funding MPs. Records show Cox moved to a separate residential property in November 2017 and started claiming £1,900 a month in rent.                   * * *                                        Scramble to make Cop count - World leaders will have to return to the negotiating table next year with improved plans to prevent disastrous levels of global heating because the emissions cuts coming out of Cop26 are too weak , architects of the 2015 Paris agreement have warned. A draft outcome text for the summit is set to be drawn up by delegates in the early hours of this morning, and discussed ahead of the 6pm deadline for the talks to finish - though previous Cop conferences have tended to go on well into Saturday and sometimes Sunday. Countries' current plans - known as nationally determined contributions  (NDCs) - would still lead to 2.4C of heating , according to analysis this week by Climate Action Tracker. Countries are currently expected to return with better pledges in 2025 but many are now demanding this be brought forward to next year's summit in Egypt.                   * * *                                        'Far from ideal but sensible enough' - Students taking A-levels and GCSEs in England will be asked to sit repeated mock exams in case national exams are cancelled for the third time. Unions and school leaders have criticised the regulator Ofqual for releasing its plan B so far past the start of the school year. Ofqual has advised that a ""sensible approach"" would be for schools once a term to set assessments under formal exam-like conditions, starting before the Christmas holidays this year, and followed by others in spring and in the first half of the summer term.  Julie McCulloch from the Association of School and College Leaders said it was ""far from ideal ... But not having a contingency plan would risk a repeat of the chaos of the past two years, and therefore, on balance, this seems like the right course of action and the confirmed set of measures appear to be sensible enough.""                   * * *                                        Charles aide quits over honours offer claim - A former aide to the Prince of Wales has resigned as head of one of Charles' charities, the Prince's Foundation, amid an alleged cash-for-honours scandal. The Mail on Sunday published a letter from 2017 in which Michael Fawcett reportedly wrote that he was willing to make an application to change businessman Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz's honorary CBE to a KBE, and support his application for citizenship, in response to ""the most recent and anticipated support""  of the Dumfries House Trust, which later became part of the Prince's Foundation. In September, Clarence House said Charles had ""no knowledge of the alleged offer"" and was fully supportive of an investigation by the Prince's Foundation. Mahfouz has denied any wrongdoing. On Thursday, Clarence House said it was also ending arrangements with Fawcett and his party planning company Premier Mode.                   * * *                                        Privilege boosts first pay packet - Graduates from poorer backgrounds earn half as much as more well-off peers in their first job  after university because they put themselves forward for fewer roles and lack family connections and financial support, research shows. Children of professionals including CEOs, doctors and teachers start out earning an average of £23,457 compared with just £11,595 for those with parents in technical, manual or service jobs. Sarah Atkinson from the Social Mobility Foundation, which produced the report with TotalJobs, said wealthier graduates could hold out for the job and salary they wanted, were better at negotiating their pay and could leverage unpaid work experience to start at a higher level. Atkinson urged employers to take steps such as targeting deprived areas and considering socioeconomic circumstances in recruitment, reporting on the backgrounds of their staff, and supporting disadvantaged graduates with moving to a new city.                   * * *                                        Collision course - Nasa is in final preparations to launch the world's first attempt to knock an asteroid off course, in case one day we need to save the Earth that way. The Double Asteroid Redirection Test (Dart) is scheduled to launch on 23 November and nearly a year later will ram into the asteroid Dimorphos at six kilometres a second. At 160 metres across, Dimorphos is about the size of the Great Pyramid of Giza. It orbits a larger asteroid called Didymos. The aim is to slow the orbit of Dimorphos slightly. If done early enough, such small diversions of an Earth-heading asteroid could be enough to avoid catastrophe.

289,Global Energy Alliance eyes RE projects in PH,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Manila Bulletin,News,678,,678,"Philippines, Republic of the",,,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK,Global Energy Alliance eyes RE projects in PH,"Manila, Nov. 12 -- A new private sector-led global organization is exploring a possible country partnership with the Philippines to assist in hastening its transition to green and renewable energy (RE) sources, the Department of Finance (DOF) said.In a statement, the DOF said on Friday, Nov. 12, that Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III met in Scotland with Rockefeller Foundation President Rajiv Shah to briefly discuss a possible list of projects that the organization can help fund for the Philippines.Rockefeller Foundation is one of the pioneers of the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP) that committed an initial $10 billion to help accelerate the implementation of clean energy projects in developing economies highly vulnerable to climate change.Aside from the Rockefeller Foundation, the GEAPP was also recently launched by the IKEA Foundation and the Bezos Earth Fund on the sidelines of the 26th United Nations (UN) Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow.The GEAPP aims to deliver transformational programs that will accelerate and scale up an equitable energy transition in developing and emerging economies, while creating millions of jobs in the process.During the meeting, Dominguez said he will discuss the GEAPP proposal with President Duterte so that a list of ""actionable"" green energy initiatives can be drawn up for consideration by the Alliance.Dominguez discussed with Shah the decommissioning and repurposing of coal-fired power plants in Mindanao and how the GEAPP can possibly assist in this initiative.The Philippines has partnered with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to pilot an Energy Transition Mechanism (ETM)-supported project in the country as the government is in the process of rehabilitating the Agus-Pulangi hydropower plant in Mindanao to improve its generating capacity.As a public-private finance vehicle, the ETM aims to both reduce coal-fired power generation through accelerated plant retirement and boost the growth of RE using an equitable, scalable, and market-based approach.The Rockefeller Foundation has signed a memorandum of understanding with the ADB on designing and establishing the ETM facility, which was launched here with the Philippines and Indonesia last Nov. 3.Dominguez said once the Agus-Pulangi power plant complex composed of seven hydropower plants increases its generating capacity, the government can proceed with its plan to gradually acquire coal-fired power plants in Mindanao and repurpose them through the ETM facility.During the meeting, Dominguez also cited the importance of the ""blended approach"" or sustainable orchestration of grants, investments, and subsidies to make climate finance work for its beneficiaries.Shah said these three aspects are the initiatives that the GEAPP wants to implement in partnership with developing and emerging economies like the Philippines.The GEAPP has already raised an initial commitment of $10 billion from philanthropists, governments, multilateral development banks, development finance institutions, and private sector partners.This commitment is intended to grow from $35 billion to $50 billion in five years, and over $ 100 billion in 10 years, according to its proponents.Dominguez, who is also Chairman-designate of the country's Climate Change Commission (CCC), headed the Philippine delegation to the COP26.The Philippines accounts for only 0.3 percent of global carbon emissions, but as an archipelago sitting on the typhoon belt and the Pacific Ring of Fire, it is among the most vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change.As its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the Paris Agreement, the Philippines has committed to a projected greenhouse gas emission reduction and avoidance of 75 percent from 2020 to 2030 for agriculture, wastes, industry, transport, and energy sectors.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Manila Bulletin.

290,Harrogate leaders back radical change at Yorkshire Climate Summit as action plan is unveiled for the region,"November 12, 2021",International,Harrogate Advertiser,News,1082,POLITICSENVIRONMENTTRAFFIC AND TRAVELHUMAN INTEREST,1082,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Graham Chalmersgraham.chalmers@jpimedia.co.uk,,,,Harrogate leaders back radical change at Yorkshire Climate Summit as action plan is unveiled for the region,"Top in UK: Harrogate achieves best shopping bounce back in nation since lockdownThe first Yorkshire Climate Summit, a non party political body, was hosted at the Royal Armories by the Yorkshire Post and was attended by several hundred representing business, local authorities and community groups from across the region.The highlight of the inaugural summit saw the launch of a 50 point it's Climate Action Plan supported by many Harrogate names who spoke at the event in support of major change.Among the names were:Wallace Sampson, Chief Executive HBC, and Senior Officer for Local Authority Coordination on the Yorkshire and Humber Climate CommissionRichard Cooper, Leader of Harrogate Borough Council, and Vice Chair of the Yorkshire and Humber Climate CommissionProf Andy Gouldson, Director of the Yorkshire and Humber Climate Commission (Harrogate resident)Prof Piers Forster, IPCC Lead Author and Member of the UK Committee on Climate Change (Harrogate resident)Holly Hanson-Maughan, Partnership and Development Lead for Harrogate CollegeHarrogate Borough Council leader Coun Richard Cooper said the situation facing the planet was an emergency and needed to be addressed as such at a local level as much as a national and international one.Coun Cooper said: ""There is a climate emergency.  Whether councils vote to declare one, whether businesses embrace the fact and react to it and whether individuals lessen their carbon footprint, it is an inescapable fact that we are altering our environment for the worse.""As councils we know that we have a big part to play in reducing the carbon footprint of the public sector. ""We know too that we need to reposition public sector purchasing to encourage the companies that supply us to decarbonise.  We need to bring together the coalition of groups who can make net zero happen in Yorkshire and the Humber. ""And we need to demonstrate determined leadership.""A major new report produced for the Climate Change Summit said Yorkshire and Humber currently emits 7.5 per cent of UK emissions - higher levels than entire countries like Croatia, Slovenia and Cyprus.The report sets the target of a 68 per cent reduction in emissions in Yorkshire and Humberside by 2025.Professor Andy Gouldson, director of the Yorkshire and Humber Climate Change Commission,  admitted it would be a challenge to achieve such an ambitious goal but it could be done.He said: “I hope this is a watershed moment and as a region we recognise the massive opportunity for us to make our lives better and the region a better place while also doing our bit for climate change.“I hope in 15 to 20 years Yorkshire is seen as a genuine leader on climate action but also as a fantastic place to live and work - partly as a result of its climate actions.”Professor Gouldson said to achieve the 2025 target, the “two big ticket items” would be the mass retrofitting of homes and commercial buildings as well as “heavy investment” in public transport, electric vehicles and walking and cycling routes.While the report estimates the transition to net zero could cost around £1.5bn to the region and highlights that currently 360,000 local jobs - around 15 per cent in the region - are in industries with high-carbon emissions, Professor Gouldson said that if done correctly, changes to the economy and embracing green industries like offshore wind could have major benefits to the region.Jemima Parker, chair of environmental pressure group Zero Carbon Harrogate, said she was encouraged by the progress made at the Yorkshire summit which has taken place in the final week of COP26 in Glasgow.She said:  ""It is really encouraging for the District to have strong leadership at a regional level as we face the climate challenge together. Yorkshire has a population of 5.5 million, larger than many small nation states.""There are many opportunities for the local economy as we transition to a net zero carbon together.The Yorkshire and Humber Climate Action plan is about putting climate action (reaching net zero and climate adaptation and resilience) at the heart of all decision making, treating the climate crisis as the emergency that it is.""It is also about taking this opportunity as we restructure to do so in a more equitable way (not leaving the poorest behind) and working with nature to create climate solutions and restore habitats.""At the conference we heard the strong support and action already being taken across the region by local authorities, businesses and community groups.""The possibility of a move to carbon reductions creating a win-win scenario for businesses is something also welcomed by Coun Cooper.""The plan shows the financial costs of what we have to do. But it also shows the financial benefits,"" Coun Cooper said. These are considerable in terms of new and growing industries in the field of decarbonisation.""We can only build this resilience and avoid further harm by working together as public sector, private business, voluntary sector and individuals. ""We need to transition to a new economy – an economy where the survival of our eco-system is the most important factor in our economic growth. ""This action plan shows us here in Yorkshire and the Humber how that can be done.""It shows how we as individuals can have an impact, how our communities, businesses and the public sector can play their part.""Included in the report’s 50 actions are calls for the integration of climate and nature into the curriculum in schools, the development of the promotion of green finance and investment and the inclusion of emissions from aviation and shipping in the region’s net zero target.While it has no policy-setting powers, the commission’s work has the support of the influential Yorkshire Leaders’ Board made up of local council and combined authority leaders and chief executives.In a joint statement, Yorkshire Leaders Board co-chairs Carl Les, leader of North Yorkshire County Council, and Sir Stephen Houghton, leader of Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council, said: “Climate change is not a remote or distant issue. Many of our communities have already experienced extreme weather in recent years.“In time, every corner of Yorkshire and Humber will be directly or indirectly impacted by the changing environment to some degree.""The Commission’s recommendations on how our region can adapt are therefore an extremely important contribution.COP26 update: What Extinction Rebellion Harrogate did in Glasgow and what is their assessment of 'progress'",Copyright 2021 JPIMedia Publishing Ltd All Rights Reserved,,Newspaper|ENGLISH|EMISSIONSCLIMATE CHANGEENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINTCOLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORSPUBLIC OFFICIALSGREENHOUSE GASESNEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSEXECUTIVESWRITERSASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONSCITY GOVERNMENT|EMISSIONSCOLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORSPUBLISHINGWRITERS|ENGLANDUNITED KINGDOMCROATIASLOVENIA,

292,"If MPs want to earn more money, quit for another job","November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),News,1293,VOICES;Pg. 33,1293,England & Wales,,,,,"If MPs want to earn more money, quit for another job","Boris Johnson is absolutely right to demand that MPs who break the rules are punished. However, if you are always moving the goalposts, as was clear in the case of Owen Paterson, it's going to be very hard to punish anyway. Which is exactly why we need people in parliament working full time for their constituents. If MPs can't get on the ministerial gravy train and want to earn more money then they can always get another job and give somebody else a chance.Geoffrey Brooking Hampshire<strong>Second jobs and sleaze</strong>While I carry no torch for MPs with outside jobs that distract from constituency work, I find it hard to see a difference in principle between that and MPs who hold well-paid ministerial appointments that have the same effect. In many ways it's worse because, as we have seen, it gives them the opportunity to divert taxpayers' funds to friends in business or to their own constituencies at the expense of others.Many people are calling for a ban on MPs having outside jobs, which I support if it includes ministerial appointments. The truth is that, in the UK, there is virtually no separation of powers between the legislature and the executive, so the Commons is rife with built-in conflicts of interest. There are other unfortunate consequences such as the great offices of state being headed by small-town politicians with no experience of managing a large organisation, nor any relevant specialist knowledge.Throw into the mix a sense of invulnerability engendered in the government by an electoral system that can be gamed to deliver an 80-seat majority on a 1.2 per cent vote swing when 70 per cent of the electorate either votes for a losing party or doesn't vote at all (probably because their vote would make no difference) and it's hardly surprising that we get scoundrels and nest featherers in charge.I stand with those recent correspondents who are ashamed of their country's government but, frankly, we the electorate have allowed it to happen and there's so much wrong it's going to take a seismic shift of some sort to put things right.Geoffrey Downs BradfordThere is a thing called the ""Overton window"". It's defined as the range of policies politically acceptable to the mainstream population at a given time. Boris Johnson and his cronies are adept at enlarging this window. All you have to do is keep repeating what you want the audience to believe until, however outrageous it is, it becomes the norm.The other technique is to keep denying something you don't want them to believe. Hence the brazen announcement by our canny prime minister that the UK is ""not remotely a corrupt country"". I note that he refers to the country, not its leaders.I appeal to all your readers to keep the Overton window no more than ajar, and to alert all their friends to this phenomenon.Lynda Newbery BristolBoris Johnson says the UK is ""not remotely a corrupt country"". Never believe anything until it has been officially denied.Nat Langdon EssexThis country is not corrupt. This government and its leaders are, particularly Boris Johnson.Andrew Milroy Address supplied<strong>Has Boris Johnson forgotten Cop26?</strong>Could there be any starker indication of the entirely justified contempt in which Boris Johnson is held by the grown-up leaders of the world than the way he has been sidelined by China and the US as they reached a critically important climate agreement at Cop26, which Johnson was supposed to be hosting? Or was it that they might not have bypassed him if they had been able to catch him during one of his very fleeting token visits to the conference to hector the delegates?My guess is that Johnson's hypocritical refusal to rule out the opening of new oil fields and a new coal mine prior to the conference made the American and Chinese delegates realise that it would be a waste of time talking to him about fossil fuels.D Maughan Brown York<strong>Reverse ferret</strong>Salma Shah's piece, (U-turns aren't always bad... except for the reverse ferret, Voices, yesterday) defines the ""reverse ferret"" thus: ""the kind of reneging that requires herculean levels of self-delusion, a pretence that a certain policy didn't mean what everyone thought it did, and anyway, it's not happening now"".In my book the worst ""reverse ferret"" jumps duplicitously further: it utterly fails to acknowledge the sudden change in policy or editorial line, or deceptively transmutes from one position to another.David Cameron's promise fundamentally to change the EU soon after morphed into the promise of a referendum. Boris Johnson's denial of the applicability of the EU withdrawal agreement. Both are recent egregious examples.Steven Fogel Address supplied<strong>Brand bargains</strong>The article by Hannah Fearn on the crisp crisis (When it comes to the crunch, this crisis will cost Johnson, Voices, yesterday) mentioned how patriotic the British were about their favourite brands.I wonder if she knows what has happened to these brands in my lifetime? Walkers now American-owned. HP Sauce now American-owned and made in the Netherlands. Branston now Japanese-owned. Heinz always American-owned. Hobnobs now Turkish-owned. Cadbury's now American-owned. Kit Kat and Quality Street now Swiss-owned. At least we still partly have Marmite owned by the Anglo Dutch Unilever.Brexit Britain takes back control?Martyn Wilson Farnborough, Hampshire<strong>Women's rights in the UAE</strong>Baroness Kennedy's article (It's an illusion that women's rights are now protected in the United Arab Emirates, Voices, 7 November) gave a false picture of the situation of women in my country, based entirely - so far as I could see - on the testimony of a small number of British women. She does not appear to have spoken to a single Emirati. As a former female parliamentarian in the UAE and co-founder of a foundation to help victims of domestic violence there, I would like to add my very different perspective.I lived through my own country's transformation, from my life as a teenager in a conservative family who did not want me to go to university, to a present day when I have been a member of our parliament and 70 per cent of graduates are women, as are a third of the cabinet and half the parliament; every government body must by law have women on its board; and women have 66 per cent of public sector jobs.We are not helpless victims of our men. We are wives and mothers, as well as teachers, policewomen, astronauts, civilian and fighter pilots, singers, actors, fashion designers and models, ministers, and members of parliament.And yes, much of this progress was due to laws introduced by our leadership, requiring government bodies to have women on their board of directors, enforcing maternity and paternity leave, and requiring companies to provide workplace nurseries.There is still work to do in protecting the most vulnerable women in our society. Domestic violence continues to be a problem, due not to inadequate laws but the lack of awareness among women of their legal rights. But it is deeply offensive to me as an Emirati woman to see articles published in the British press that claim to judge my country based entirely on the views and experiences of European women. I hope this letter can serve as a corrective.Afra Albasti UAE<strong>Appease Cleese, please</strong>I feel Katie Edwards is wrong to say John Cleese made a daft remark on Twitter ('Self-cancelling' is a great PR stunt - just ask Cleese, News, yesterday). What he has done is expose the inconsistency of his invitation (given his Hitler impressions are very well known, at least by anyone aware of Monty Python or Fawlty Towers) and the cancelling - or blacklisting - of Andrew Graham Dixon for doing something very similar.T Foster Colchester",Copyright 2021 Independent Print Ltd All Rights Reserved,,Newspaper|IA|ENGLISH|Voices|GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERSLEGISLATIVE BODIESRESIGNATIONSBRITISH PARLIAMENTELECTIONSGOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONPOLITICAL CORRUPTIONHEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENTNEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWSPOLITICSPRIME MINISTERSFULL TIME EMPLOYMENT|JANOS ADERBORIS JOHNSON|UNITED KINGDOM,
293,India's Dhamma traditions can show way towards post-pandemic life,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Indian Express,News,796,,796,"India, Republic of",,,,,India's Dhamma traditions can show way towards post-pandemic life,"Written by Pema KhanduFor a practising Buddhist like me, ""dharma"" (dhamma in Pali) would generally mean the teachings of the Buddha - the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. These teachings have been the guiding light for all Buddhists for over 2,500 years. In some places, Dharma, or Dhamma, is also referred to as the ""cosmic law"".There is a story from the life of Lord Buddha that I would like to share. One day the Buddha asked his monks, ""How long is one's life?"" One of them replied, ""A few years."" Someone answered, ""A few days!"" Another responded, ""Between meals!"" Finally, the Buddha said, ""Life lasts for the duration of one breath."" One breath is all that life is. And the Covid-19 pandemic has made us realise the value of our breath. The past two years have seen great misery around the world due to the pandemic. We have lost people close to us. We have also started to look more inwards in these two years. This pandemic has made us realise the value of family and the joys of life that we often ignored.On the pandemic, His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, shared his thoughts: ""Ancient Indian tradition describes the creation, abiding and destruction of worlds over time. Among the causes of such destruction are armed conflict and disease, which seems to accord with what we are experiencing today. However, despite the enormous challenges we face, living beings, including humans, have shown a remarkable ability to survive"". Indeed, humans have this remarkable ability to survive - our ancient wisdom of Dharma or Dhamma teaches us to come together in times of adversity. The entire scientific fraternity came together and got us the vaccine in record time. Such is the power of humanity.The Dharma Dhamma traditions of our country provide such paths that can help build a post-Covid world order. Lord Buddha talks of an Eightfold Path, which is constituted by the right view, right aspiration, right speech, right conduct, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right meditational attainment.Nagarjuna, one of the greatest philosophers of India, showed the ""Middle Way"" to the world and, taking inspiration from his teachings, I would like to discuss the ""right livelihood"" for a post-Covid world. There is a conference going on in Glasgow on climate change called COP26. Global leaders have made commitments to make Mother Earth a sustainable planet, to mitigate global warming, protect vulnerable communities and natural habitats, mobilise finance and work together to deliver on these promises.Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivered a historic speech at COP26 where he talked of ""LIFE - L, I, F, E, which means 'Lifestyle For Environment'"". He added: ""This can become a mass movement of an environmentally-conscious lifestyle. What is needed today is mindful and deliberate utilisation, instead of mindless and destructive consumption."" The Prime Minister made unprecedented commitments on behalf of India at this global conference and presented the concept of ""Panchamrit"", to deal with this challenge, which included becoming carbon-neutral country 2070.These commitments are huge and would require the ""right livelihood"" to achieve them. I come from the land of Arunachal Pradesh. There are 26 major tribes in my state and over 100 sub-tribes. We have a forest cover of around 80 per cent, which is among the highest in the country. Our tribes value jal, jungle and zameen, and have evolved to live in harmony with them. In current times there is a need to find the right balance to fulfil the development aspirations of society and conserve natural resources. Development in the 21st century will have to find a way to incentivise states like Arunachal Pradesh, which are natural carbon sinks, to preserve our rivers and forests.The right livelihood that I am talking of requires true contentment and happiness which lies in needs, not wants. Success will not be found through the gratification of desire but at the end of desire - which is contentment. Wealthy will be the person who enjoys what they have. The philosophy and practices of right livelihood involve doing what needs to be done for the wellbeing of the self, others and our planet.It is time now to advocate and work towards reviving the Nalanda tradition of Buddhism in India. This treasure of knowledge and traditions, preserved over centuries by our Tibetan sisters and brothers under the aegis of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, must be translated into all the major Indian languages. I hope learned scholars will build upon these thoughts comprehensively for a harmonious world order.The writer is the chief minister of Arunachal Pradesh.

294,I spent 60 years taking care of and improving the land. Why am I now one of the villains?,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Herald (Glasgow),News,872,Pg. 19,872,Scotland,Drew Allan ,,,,I spent 60 years taking care of and improving the land. Why am I now one of the villains?,"AS someone who has retired from farming after 60 years, I have been following the climate/politics/dramatics/blah blah blah debate in Glasgow. What an unhappy wee lassie, and all those young schoolkids on the streets being dragged into something they cannot understand. When I was that age my biggest fear was the bogey man.After 60 years of farming, when I thought I was a caretaker and improver of the land I farmed, I'm faced with part of the blame for global warming, deeper oceans and cow farts. When I farmed Southcairn on the shore of the Machars peninsula down in Wigtownshire we could find raised beaches 200 yards back from the shore, from 10,000 years before I farmed there, so the rising oceans wasn't my fault.Cattle and other ruminants have the ability to consume and digest forage which grows on land unsuitable for the production of grain and the like and convert it into proteins (one of the important building blocks of human life).The biggest contributor to the production of carbon/methane is the human race. Do you want to reduce their numbers?Cattle numbers are actually lower than 40 years ago. Cattle are blamed for 2 per cent of methane so if you reduce cattle numbers by 50% you only reduce their contribution by 1%As a graduate of the ""common sense academy"", the way I see it is: the customer is always right but the consumer should always pay, so the most direct way of reducing emissions is by reducing freight by means of taxation, which means if you want something out of season from a distance there should be a tax or penalty based on its carbon footprint. Similarly, until they find a more environmental way of travel, holiday nearer home. But then again, I'm just an old retired farmer. David Caldwell,  Turnberry.Ignorance of  the politiciansI LISTENED to the BBC's World at One interview today (November 10) with Robert Courts, UK Minister for Aviation in the Department for Transport. He was asked what the aviation industry is doing to curb its emissions. In response, he said he'd recently been to Bristol Airport, where they were investing in a fleet of electric baggage trolleys and pushback tugs - the latter push aircraft back from the terminal into a position where they can start engines. This was another head-in-hands moment for me, not the first I've had during COP26. A large passenger aircraft flying from the UK to Singapore and back will burn around 300 tonnes of fuel and produce about 1,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Using electric baggage trolleys and pushback tugs before and after both sectors might save 50 kilograms of carbon dioxide but let's be generous and call it 100kg. That's still only one-10-thousandths of the carbon dioxide produced in flight, or 0.01 per cent. We're going to have to do a little better than that if we're going to limit climate change.I note that Mr Courts is a lawyer by training. Perhaps Westminster needs a lot of lawyers to cover for those MPs who choose to practise law in the Caribbean. But I'm not entirely convinced that lawyers always know so much about the practicalities of operating planes, trains and transport networks that we should be putting them in charge of the billions of our money that is spent in those areas.Doug Maughan,  Dunblane.Scottish Rugby must try harderWHILE I thoroughly enjoyed the sporting experience of taking my young family to watch Scotland beat Australia at Murrayfield last Saturday (November 6), I was appalled at the huge amounts of undifferentiated rubbish accumulating in the bins around the stadium. The large majority of this was plastic drinks cups, cans and recyclable food packaging. There were no recycling bins available.During COP26, this is especially shameful and reflects poorly on those responsible. My 10-year-old son, who is learning about climate change, could see it as an obvious problem that could easily be rectified. Why can't those in charge?Dr John Farley,  Dunblane.Understated  ironyMAY I thank Al Cowie (Letters, November 11) for adding to my list of figures of speech with his example of litotes, of which my teachers of English seem to have been unaware.A topical example might be ""These are not the best of days for the Conservative Party"".David Miller,  Milngavie.Let sailors  bewareYOU note that the Grill pub in Aberdeen was a men-only establishment until 1975 (""10 of our favourite cosy pubs across Scotland to coorie up in and chase the winter away"", Herald Magazine"", November 6). Perhaps because this designation could have suggested that dogs weren't admitted, the sign above the entrance read ""No Ladies"".Back then reasonable discrimination was evidently acceptable. A Rothesay pub used to have a sign at the entrance that read ""Nae yatsmen. Lepers and Campbells welcome, but nae yatsmen.""Robin Dow,  Rothesay.Touch of a genius at age of sevenCONGRATULATIONS to Peter Doig with his painting selling for £30 million (""Scottish painter's artwork sells for £30m"", The Herald, November 11).

Official figures said nearly 600 people died amid the conditions that saw Canada's heat records broken when the mercury hit 49.6C on June 29 in the village of Lytton. A day later, a resulting wildfire destroyed the community; one of dozens of wildfires that broke out, with the thick smoke causing air quality to plunge to levels 43 times worse than normal.\xC2The doctor linked the two?Dr Merritt said his patient's existing conditions were impacted severely. He said: ""She has diabetes. She has some heart failure\xE2 she lives in a trailer, no air conditioning. All of her health problems have all been worsened. And she's really struggling to stay hydrated.\xE2 He added: ""We're in the emergency department, we look after everybody, from the most privileged to the most vulnerable, from cradle to grave, we see everybody. And it's hard to see people, especially the most vulnerable people in our society, being affected. It's frustrating. If we're not looking at the underlying cause, and we're just treating the symptoms, we're just gonna keep falling further and further behind.\xE2\xC2His peers agreed?His colleagues shared his opinion and he set about forming an internal group of about 40 medical professionals called ""Doctors and Nurses for Planetary Health.\xE2 In a statement on its website, the group says: ""As physicians and nurses, we saw first-hand the physical and mental effects of climate change on our patients and communities.

297,Mid-fall: the frost is a small sign of hope,"November 12, 2021 Friday",U.S. Federal,University Wire,News,666,FEATURES;Pg. 1,666,,Holden Turner,,,,Mid-fall: the frost is a small sign of hope,"Sophie LipsetThe frost is here, at last. When I step out to go to class, I'm greeted with a blanket of ice on the grass, the trees and my bike seat. Thankfully, it hasn't come too late. Compared to some frost maps of Maine from the 1970s, it appears that the first freeze was late by about two weeks this year. I revise my earlier sentence: I'm thankful the frost has come at all.Dante Alighieri composed an epic simile about frost to open Canto 24 of his ""Inferno."" In it, he  imagines a farmer going out and complaining about how the frost has prevented his herd from grazing and only when the sun thaws the field does the farmer rejoice. The opposite is true for me 700 years later: the frost brings joy. It's a small comfort to see the seasons coming with some regularity.This winter, we will likely get days of extreme cold, so far below freezing that you may wonder aloud if global warming might not be a bad thing. Though I never say anything, I almost cry when someone makes that joke in front of me. A single conversation with someone who studies the earth-a savvy farmer or scientist, it doesn't matter which-will reveal that the increasing variability that we're seeing, where frosts are late and cold snaps are followed by balmy days, is a sign of dramatic change on our planet.The 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) is happening in Glasgow right now. In essence, world leaders are there to negotiate climate policy. Many who watch climate politics are desperately hoping that this summit will result in a productive agreement to significantly curb global carbon emissions. The negotiations bring up countless ethical questions that have no definitive answer: which countries should have to reduce their emissions first? And how? And by how much? It is easy for me to block out the proceedings because it can be frustrating to watch promises that seem to go nowhere. Additionally, we can comment with frustration about how world leaders are entirely failing by failing to take action. In imagining a just, livable future, it's hard to see any justice coming from the global negotiation room anymore.I'm holding onto hope by clutching my figurative safety blankets. In the garden, we're putting blankets on the beds to keep them cozy and protected from the winter weather. Volunteers have been spreading carbon-rich compost across last year's soil, draping the ground in straw and netting that will help the earth rest until the spring season. This process helps the beds ward off the freezing temperatures at night in the same way that we're closing our windows in advance of the cold ahead.Warm blankets reassure me that there are still comforts and justices running throughout this world. Small wins, you could say. For instance, it's a blue-sky blessing that Jes Staley's presence at Bowdoin has come to an end. Staley is starting to face consequences for his actions thanks to bottom-up student protest and top-down legal oversight. I'll leave it open as to what mid-level bystanders did to hasten his departure. In this case, I'm reminding myself that we can always resist what we believe is wrong and that we have the right to assert what is right. But, we cannot lead with a vendetta; we cannot meet the injustice with excessive retribution. There is no place for hate. My safety blanket comes from seeing the effects of calm and thoughtful anger.Small wins are spurring me on. The garden, and most gardens that I've known, are small wins in a time and place that can breed personal frustration with the way things go. I am hopeful, perhaps too hopeful, for good outcomes from COP26. Yes, I believe that global leaders are too wedded to economic growth to achieve drawdown, and yes, there is a lack of leadership coming from powerful nations despite Sir David Attenborough's rousing speech. However, maybe in that collection of voices there will come some resolution for a well-knit world. Maybe with calm and thoughtful resistance, we can ensure that the frosts will return.",Copyright 2021 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|Brunswick|ME|EXTREME TEMPERATURESEMISSIONSAGREEMENTSETHICSWEATHERCLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION & POLICYCLIMATOLOGYGLOBAL WARMINGCONFERENCES & CONVENTIONSGREENHOUSE GASES|EMISSIONSGLOBAL WARMING|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|EARTHMAINE, USA",

It is a process that effectively gives every nation a veto in the talks.Professor White, who is Forests, Oceans, Environment and Climate Change Minister for the West African nation of Gabon, said the urgency of the climate science is at odds with the slow process inside negotiating rooms at COP26.The public ""need politicians to come up with a more reactive, rapid way of making these decisions about the climate,"" he said.Professor White stressed he was offering his views in his personal capacity as a conservationist and climate scientist, rather than as a minister speaking on behalf of Gabon or the African group of negotiators, which Gabon leads.""I think we are heading to a very bad place,"" he said.""I still don't think we have quite the urgency we need with this process.

In his speech at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 26) in Glasgow, Tuan Ibrahim said Malaysia is looking forward to the completion of the Paris rulebook during COP26 to stay on track to achieve the 1.5°C goal. He stressed that there needs to be a clear modality for Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) implementation and the establishment of cooperative arrangements. ""Taking into account the serious impact of global warming and the unprecedented challenges due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Malaysia recognises the urgency to build back better through green recovery,"" he said. Tuan Ibrahim also announced Malaysia's updated NDCs to reduce its economy-wide carbon intensity (against GDP) by 45% in 2030 compared to 2005 levels, which is an increase of 10% from the earlier submission. In addition, Malaysia's NDCs now covers seven greenhouse gases (GHG) instead of three GHG previously. ""Malaysia also aspires to achieve a net-zero GHG emission target earliest by 2050, pending the completion of its Long-Term Low Emissions Development Strategy by 2022,"" he said. He outlined eight measures to achieve these ambitious targets, including the implementation of carbon pricing policy in phases to support national efforts to reduce GHG emissions; achievement of 31% of renewable energy capacity for power generation in 2025 via its Malaysia's Energy Transition Plan to 2021-2040; aspiration for 100% of government fleets to be non-internal combustion engine vehicles by 2030; maintaining at least 50% forest cover as pledged during the Rio Earth Summit 1992; implementing natural-based solutions as a basis to reduce long-term impacts through planting of 100 million trees; moving towards Zero Waste directed to landfill through the Waste to Energy concept and to increase its recycling rate target to 40% by 2025; transforming cities in Malaysia towards low carbon pathway as outlined under the National Low Carbon City Masterplan; and increasing long-term resilience towards climate change impacts through the development of the National Adaptation Plan. In addition, he stated that two of Malaysia's energy companies have rolled out their plans to achieve a net-zero emissions target by 2050, and the Malaysian government has agreed to support the Global Methane Pledge as well as the Glasgow Leaders Declaration on Forests and Land Use. ""In this regard, Malaysia is willing to work with all parties to ensure the success of COP26,"" he added.

300,Mountains of Garbage Rise Outside Summit,"November 12, 2021 Friday",New York,The New York Times,News,1121,Section A;Column 0;Foreign Desk;Pg. 4,1121,,By Jenny Gross,,,,Mountains of Garbage Rise Outside Summit,"At COP26, delegates address the need to curb emissions and mass consumption to save the planet while the reality of today's throwaway society is all too apparent nearby.GLASGOW -- In Gaelic, ''Glasgow'' translates to ''dear green place,'' a nod to the parks, gardens and flourishing green spaces throughout the city. But according to Chris Mitchell, who was a garbage collector there for more than two decades, the only thing flourishing in Glasgow these days is ''a mountain of waste.''   As diplomats at the U.N. climate summit in Glasgow this week preach about the need to curb both greenhouse gas emissions and mass consumption to protect the planet, the reality of today's throwaway society can be seen just a short way from the conference's doorstep.  Outside the gleaming center of Scotland's largest city, dumpsters and trash cans are overflowing. The city's rat population has surged, with four garbage workers hospitalized because of attacks over the past five months. And litter is strewn across streets.  Mr. Mitchell, a senior official for the GMB Scotland trade union, which represents the city's 1,000 garbage collectors among other workers, said they staged an eight-day strike that ended on Monday because they were tired of poor working conditions, lack of respect from management and low wages. It is a cry that has been echoed throughout Britain, the United States and other parts of the world, where essential workers who carried communities through the worst of the pandemic are saying they will no longer stand for being overworked and underpaid.  ''We kept people safe,'' said Mr. Mitchell, 45, who started working as a garbage collector when he was 16. ''We cared for the most vulnerable. We cared for the elderly.'' He appreciated the nightly clap for key workers during the pandemic. But now that coronavirus cases have subsided from peak levels, he feels the government has ''abandoned low paid workers who have saved this nation.''  In parts of the city, trash is now collected only once every three weeks, down from once every two weeks about a year ago. That means garbage collectors, many of whom make less than 20,000 British pounds ($27,000) a year, have to carry heavier loads up and down steps.  On top of the less frequent collections, volumes of trash per household climbed over the past two years, a reflection of increased spending on takeout and online deliveries, according to Mr. Mitchell.  ''The pandemic has created waste upon waste upon waste,'' he said.  The city of about 635,000 has urged residents to reduce their waste to help protect the environment, but garbage collectors like Jack McGowan, 26, say that reducing collections is not an effective way to achieve that.  ''The bins are always like that,'' he said on Wednesday, gesturing to several overflowing dumpsters behind a block of apartments in Scotstoun, an area west of the Glasgow city center. ''We need better pay. Respect as well.''  Mr. McGowan said he lives with his mother because he cannot afford a mortgage on his salary of £19,000 a year.  He said he had already seen four rats jump out of trash cans that morning alone.  Glasgow promotes its recycling program and efforts to become more environmentally friendly. But Mr. McGowan said he saw examples every day of people putting nonrecyclable trash in recycling bins.  Garbage collectors said they were likely to strike again in the run-up to Christmas if they do not get pay increases. In a statement, the Glasgow City Council said that the leader of the council had already had extensive conversations with the union and that the ''door remains open to all trade union colleagues.''  Fiona Ross, a council spokeswoman, said she could not go into further detail because talks were continuing.  Meanwhile, the delegates inside the COP26 summit in Glasgow say they are making some progress toward an agreement to avert catastrophic levels of climate change.  On Wednesday, the United States and China issued a joint statement in which they pledged to do more to cut emissions this decade and in which China committed for the first time to address emissions from methane. Separately, the United Nations climate agency released a draft of an accord that urged nations ''to accelerate the phasing out'' of greenhouse gas emissions.  But outside the climate talks, there is a mounting frustration over the disconnect between policymakers and those most affected by climate change. There have been daily protests organized by youth activists, who say that pledges by countries that they will commit to goals that are decades away is not enough.  ''Nobody really wants to incur the cost of preventing climate change today,'' said Sayantan Ghosal, an economics professor at the University of Glasgow's business school. ''They're willing to do it tomorrow, but they're not willing to do it today.''  There has also been a gap between world leaders and business executives on the one hand, who have talked this week about the urgent need for a transition to clean energy, and the working class people on the other who will be most affected by the rising costs associated with that transition.  Many of the lowest paid workers in society, including garbage collectors, are more worried about increasing prices of food, rent and energy than about increasing temperatures. They often do not have the flexibility to spend more on food and clothing that are more sustainable.  As the U.S. economy picks up again, after a lull during the pandemic, people are quitting their jobs in record numbers, according to data from the U.S. Department of Labor. There are five million fewer people working than before the pandemic began, and employers have struggled to find enough health care workers, waiters, truck drivers and butchers.  This has given employees newfound leverage and power.  The number of workers on strike in the United States increased in October to more than 25,000, versus an average of about 10,000 in the previous three months, according to data collected by the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University.  The shortages have disrupted Britain, which has struggled to find workers to make up for the thousands of European workers who left in five years since Britain voted to leave the European Union.  Mr. Mitchell, the senior union official, said that 20 drivers had left the garbage collection team in recent weeks for other truck driving jobs that are offering better pay.  Peter Welsh, a union spokesman, said Scotland needed to invest in the workers who will help deliver a transition to a greener economy.  ''There are huge, huge challenges that I don't quite think mainstream politics have begun to grasp and understand,'' he said.",Copyright 2021 The New York Times Company,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|SOLID WASTE COLLECTIONEMISSIONSMOUNTAINSESSENTIAL BUSINESSES & WORKERSCONFERENCES & CONVENTIONSGREENHOUSE GASESLABOR & EMPLOYMENTLABOR UNIONSSTRIKESWAGES & SALARIESCONSERVATIONINFECTIOUS DISEASESENIOR CITIZENSCORONAVIRUSESVIRUSES|SOLID WASTE COLLECTIONEMISSIONS|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|SCOTLANDUNITED KINGDOMUNITED STATES",

317,"Now this is a crisis;Here's a puzzle for you. How to reduce your greenhouse gas emissions by 57% from 1990 levels in the next eight years. Don't know? You're in good company, says Richard Digard","November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Guernsey Press,News,1051,NEWS;Pg. 17,1051,England & Wales,Richard Digard,,GUERNSEY'S,GUERNSEY'S,"Now this is a crisisHere's a puzzle for you. How to reduce your greenhouse gas emissions by 57% from 1990 levels in the next eight years. Don't know? You're in good company, says Richard Digard","WHEN I heard Environment and Infrastructure president Lindsay de Sausmarez declare that Guernsey could be a global force for good when it comes to climate change, I must confess my heart sank. After all, how many times have we heard our various leaders declaring that the island is/could be world-class in this or that?Why should we? you immediately wonder. At what cost and for what benefit?In fairness to Deputy de Sausmarez, she was speaking about the role we can play through green finance. There, the 'prize' is immense. While developing states in the south are pressing Western nations to contribute $100 billion in annual funding, the Stern Review on the economics of climate change puts the external cash requirement at closer to $1 trillion every year for the rest of this decade. That's a colossal sum and it's not coming from governments - they don't have it. Instead, it's coming from private global capital, where this island really has a part to play.So if Deputy de Sausmarez's committee confines itself to that, she will have my full support. My fear, however, is that the island - or those responsible for its policy decisions - won't be content with a bare minimum, pragmatic approach. Don't get me www.wrong.No one who saw the leader of Tuvalu standing thighdeep in the sea around his eroding island delivering a virtual address to COP26 could be unaware of the urgency of combating climate change.But while China, Russia and Brazil refuse to take the situation seriously, nothing this island does, or doesn't do, will make much difference. Yes, we all have a part to play - but it's how we choose to do that which is all-important. Guernsey's biggest greenhouse gas emissions come from*, in order, transport (29%), electricity generation (17%), domestic and commercial heating (11%) and industrial use (10%). In all, the island released rather less than 400 metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2018 - significant when you consider how little gas weighs, but trivial compared with the 5.1 billion tonnes from America alone in 2019 or 33 billion tonnes from the world as a whole.My point here is not to say do nothing - far from it - there are, happily, probably fewer climate change deniers now than anti-vaxxers - but to ask how you reduce the 113 tonnes of local transport CO2 to nothing and who pays.For instance, while the island is legislating for a target of net zero emissions (or carbon neutrality) in relation to greenhouse gases by 2050, it has an interim target of reducing such emissions by 57% on 1990 levels by 2030.That's not far away, and while the 1990 figures were way higher, knocking 60% off that still leaves us a tidy challenge, even at today's reduced levels.That's especially the case since no one knows what they're supposed to do now, while there's still eight years' grace to play with. Can I buy a hybrid and do my bit that way? How does, say,Creasey's reduce its energy footprint to comply?If you've one of Guernsey's many thousands of elderly properties with no real insulation, how do you afford to bring it up to a standard where a heat pump can truly replace your oil boiler? And as an especially scary thought, one recent estimate says CO2 emissions fell by just 17% when much of the developed world locked down for Covid and have now bounced back to prepandemic levels.States' Trading Supervisory Board member Nick Moakes wondered in these pages the other day whether wind power was an option for the island. In my lay terms, yes and no.Turbine technology is now plug and play, so decide what output you require and bingo. While the wind blows, that is, and if you don't mind an array off the north coast. But why should aesthetics get in the way of mitigating climate change?Anyway, official policy is to spend up to £100m. on a further cable link with France which, while a reliable way to date of keeping the lights on and decarbonising electricity here, has never been more politically exposed, as President Macron seeks to establish himself as the strong homme of Europe.My biggest fear is that we'll simply mess up the whole transition and the States will dump the cost on Mr and Mrs Guernsey.Look at it this way. We can't balance the books now and tax increases are powering down the track to cover past profligacy. The States' accounts can't be taken at face value and we have substantial debts and liabilities, excluding the States employees' pension fund.Yet now, housing, which has, on and off, been a problem/crisis (depending on economic cycle) since the Nazis were sent packing is now back firmly in crisis mode. Yep, we've had more than 70 years to ensure islanders are decently and affordably housed, blown that entirely, and now want to move on to saving the planet.Well, not quite. But hitting Guernsey's own interim carbon target by 2030 will not be pain- or cost-free, yet neither you nor I have a clue how that's supposed to happen, what we're required to do or what happens if we can't afford to take the prescribed steps.And that's in the knowledge we have to do at least as much again in the following 20 years to 2050, when the island has pledged to have net zero emissions. That's supposing, of course, the worsening climate crisis hasn't dragged the deadline forward. So there you have it. A proper crisis, 76 years after the last one, but this time with all the warning in the world and what, exactly, to show for it?Yes, we have Mitigate Climate Change - States of Guernsey Climate Change Policy & Action Plan, which was approved by the States in 2020. But if you're like me, you won't have a clue what it means in practice.Worse, neither do your deputies. It's not in the top 10 Government Work Plan priority actions and the predecessor Future Guernsey Plan was merely aspirational about setting it as an 'area of focus'.So buckle up folks. The crisis we're in but barely responding to is going to be particularly unpleasant.*Based on rounded 2018 figures ?

318,Oilpatch seeks answers on emissions cap amid fears of throttled production,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Peace Country Sun,News,975,OPINION;Pg. A6,975,Alberta,Chris VarcoePeace Country Sun,,,,Oilpatch seeks answers on emissions cap amid fears of throttled production,"A new federal limit on greenhouse gas emissions is coming for the Canadian oil and gas industry.Does it mean the end of growth for a key sector of the economy? Will it cause investment, jobs and production to shift outside of the country? Or will it activate massive spending in new emissions-reduction projects? So many questions. So little clarity. So much is at stake.""We are not particularly fussed by a cap on emissions, subject to a couple of provisos,"" Cenovus Energy CEO Alex Pourbaix said in an interview Wednesday.""Those caps must correspond to the industry's ability to actually, physically reduce its GHG emissions... These are things that cannot be done overnight."" Pourbaix, who is chair of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), also believes a price on carbon needs to be applied globally.It's something Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pushed for at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow this week - and something that isn't in place in the United States.Aside from the federal government's plan to cap oil and gas emissions, Ottawa has already established a national price on carbon, which is set to rise to $170 by the end of this decade.While the U.S. and more than 100 other countries have signed on to reducing methane emissions by 30 per cent by the end of 2030, Canada has gone further, announcing a planned cut of 75 per cent.A price on carbon needs to be applied globally ""so that early movers like Canada, in terms of decarbonizing their economy, are not handicapped by other countries that have no interest in pricing carbon or putting any restrictions on their industry,"" said Pourbaix.The international climate conference in Scotland will help determine just how ambitious countries are prepared to be in the coming years.At COP26, Trudeau announced his government will become the first major oil and gas-producing county to adopt such an emissions cap on the industry.Back at home, Ottawa remains in discussion with the sector on a proposed federal tax credit for carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) projects, which would sequester CO2 emissions underground.The technology could make a major difference for oilsands operators and other industrial sectors as the country strives to reach its net-zero target by 2050.On Wednesday, ConocoPhillips Canada joined an alliance of five other major oilsands producers, including Cenovus and Suncor Energy, that have agreed to jointly pursue net-zero emissions within three decades.""What it really does is just show the interest right across our entire industry in reducing emissions,"" said Al Reid, director of the alliance.The group has said its longer-term plans could cost up to $75 billion over three decades; it is seeking federal assistance to help foot the bill.Alberta has called for at least $30 billion in federal incentives over the span of a decade.""People forget we're actually pretty aligned with the federal government on this. They have a net-zero target in 2050 and that's the same target we have come out with,"" said Pourbaix.These two sides are singing from the same song sheet, for now.But Premier Jason Kenney vowed earlier this week his government will fight any anti-oil push to ""leave it in the ground."" As for future oil and gas production increases in Canada, that will depend on several factors, including commodity prices, investor pressure and the ability of companies to move product to markets.""It obviously depends on where the cap is set,"" said Pourbaix.""I expect on a go-forward basis, you will continue to see growth, but it's going to be a lot more measured.""The federal government has referred many of these tough questions about the emissions cap to its net-zero advisory board. The group will face an enormous challenge to help the government establish five-year milestones for the industry.According to federal officials, the cap will apply to emissions from conventional oil and natural gas production, as well as the oilsands.So far, there has been little communication with the province or industry players about details of the federal limit.The head of the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada (EPAC) said companies are committed to lowering their emissions, but the group's members - small and intermediate-sized producers - are frustrated by a lack of consultation from Ottawa.""There's been no engagement whatsoever from anyone in the federal government on the cap. We have no idea what it is,"" said EPAC president Tristan Goodman.If these federal measures serve to crimp production, it could push investment and jobs into other oil-producing countries that don't have the same rules in place.""Leadership is a good thing until you're out leading and no one is following - and then you are just all by yourself,"" said energy consultant Greg Stringham.The provincial government already has a 100-megatonne emissions cap on the oilsands, which was adopted by the former Notley government, although the implementing regulations are not in place.Total emissions from the oilsands sector (as defined by the provincial cap) reached 64 megatonnes in 2019, although the federal government views it as being closer to 83 megatonnes under its criteria, said analyst Kevin Birn of energy consultancy IHS Markit.IHS has projected oilsands emissions peaking within the decade (even before the oilsands alliance was formed and adopted tougher targets) while total Canadian oil production is projected to climb until the early 2030s.However, much will depend on the new federal limit.""A cap on oil and gas emissions, if it is too stringent and too soon, will reduce and throttle production output,"" said Birn.""And when it does that, those production barrels aren't necessarily going to disappear from the world. They just won't be produced by Canada.""

United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland",By Perthshire Advertiser,,,,Perth companies to pilot new community electric vehicle charging hub,"Energy giants SSE and bus firm Stagecoach are pooling their collective energy and transport expertise to pilot a new community electric vehicle charging hub.Their aim is to drive Scotland on the road to net zero.Plans were announced as SSE's Road to Renewables e-bus tour celebrating low carbon projects and people across the UK, reached the company's Perth headquarters.With Glasgow hosting COP26, Stagecoach and SSE's collaboration will maximise the efficiency of EV infrastructure and encourage the take up of green transport in Scotland.Under the plans Stagecoach bus depots, which SSE Energy Solutions provide the EV infrastructure for, could become available to other fleet users such as logistics companies, when buses are out on service.Second appeal from group wanting to build new church outside Perth is rejected by councillorsKinross family back meningitis campaign to remember daughter lost to the disease at just eight-years-oldNormally, buses are normally out on the road providing vital community links from around 7am to 7pm and are then charged overnight.This means the charging infrastructure is potentially free and available during the day for other electric vehicles to be charged from. This approach could assist efforts to create a network of rapid charging hubs for fleets which travel across the country.Transport produced over a quarter of the UK's total carbon emissions before the pandemic, with 91 per cent coming from road transport vehicles. The biggest contributors to this were cars and taxis, accounting for 61 per cent of the emissions from road transport, while a total of 35% is from Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs) and vans.General In Your Area WidgetKevin Welstead, EV sector director of SSE Energy Solutions, said: ""This is a game changing idea with the potential to really accelerate Scotland's journey to net zero. COP26 coming to Scotland is a vivid reminder that we need to get more green and clean transport on our roads; and we believe a network of EV community hubs could hold the key to doing just that. We're excited to be partnering with Stagecoach on this pilot who share our vision to get more people using greener transport so we can provide cleaner air and combat climate change.""Sam Greer, Stagecoach regional director for Scotland, said: ""We are delighted to be launching a pilot of the community charging hub concept in partnership with SSE, two companies with strong commitments to delivering on Scotland's net zero ambitions. Electric charging infrastructure is a significant investment.""As well as helping accelerate decarbonisation, it would complement the wider opportunities beyond technology to cut carbon emissions from the transport sector and reduce local air pollution through a shift away from cars to more sustainable public transport, cycling and walking.""Eco flag distinction for green crusaders at Kinross High SchoolChocolate and whisky shop will open in Dunkeld despite objectionsDuring the photocall at SSE's Perth headquarters at Inveralmond House, staff learned more about how they can play their part in combating climate change by choosing greener EV options for themselves.Stagecoach has partnered with SSE to deliver the charging infrastructure for its new e-buses being introduced before the end of 2021 at its depots in Aberdeen and Perth.The location for the new community charging hub pilot will be announced later this year.",Copyright 2021 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper; Web Publication|WEBDAR|ENGLISH|ELECTRIC VEHICLESELECTRIC MOBILITYELECTRIC VEHICLE INDUSTRYSUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATIONEMISSIONSTRANSPORTATION SECTOR PERFORMANCECARBON NEUTRAL INITIATIVESGREENHOUSE GASESALLIANCES & PARTNERSHIPSAIR POLLUTIONAIR QUALITYNEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSPOLLUTION & ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTSINFLAMMATORY DISEASESMENINGITISNEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS & INJURIESCLIMATE CHANGEWALKING & JOGGING|ELECTRIC VEHICLESMOTORCOACHES & BUSESELECTRIC MOBILITYELECTRIC VEHICLE INDUSTRYSUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATIONEMISSIONSALTERNATIVE & RENEWABLE ENERGYENERGY & UTILITIESTRANSPORTATION & WAREHOUSINGTRANSPORTATION SECTOR PERFORMANCECARBON NEUTRAL INITIATIVESBEER, WINE & LIQUOR STORES|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|SCOTLANDUNITED KINGDOM",

329,PH joins pledge to end global deforestation,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Manila Times,News,856,,856,"Philippines, Republic of the",Catherine S. Valente,,CONVENTION ON BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY,CONVENTION ON BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY,PH joins pledge to end global deforestation,"THE Philippines joined over 100 countries in signing a declaration committing to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030.The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) transmitted President Rodrigo Duterte's letter to the government of the United Kingdom formalizing the Philippines' commitment to end deforestation by 2030 as stated under the Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forests and Land Use.In his letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Duterte said the action areas expressed in the Leaders' Declaration are consistent with the targets and goals of the Philippines in attaining sustainable forest management.The President said the Declaration is also consistent with the Philippines' National Climate Change Action Plan 2011-2028, ""particularly under Ecological and Environmental Stability that is focused on the protection and rehabilitation of critical ecosystems, and restoration of ecological services.""""Sustainable and resilient agriculture and forestry are essential for commodity production and achieving the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals), promoting economic development, reducing poverty food security, and improving the livelihoods of billions of people,"" Duterte said.The Philippines believes that through collective action and efforts among countries and regions, it will be able to deliver the action areas under the Declaration, and even the targets of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, the UN Convention to Combat Desertification, the SDGs, and other initiatives, he added.The Philippines' support for the Leaders' Declaration was upon the recommendation of Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez 3rd, who is the chairman-designate of the Climate Change Commission and head of the country's delegation to the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland.COP26 gathered around 120 leaders in two weeks of global negotiations to help determine whether humanity can drive forward the urgent action needed to avoid catastrophic climate change.The main agenda is to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial averages by the end of the century. The actions to reduce emissions need to start now to be able cut them by 50 percent by 2030 to reach the target.The leaders' declaration included commitments to conserve forests and other terrestrial ecosystems as well as to accelerate their restoration.The world leaders agreed on reducing vulnerability, building resilience and enhancing rural livelihoods along with implementing and redesigning agricultural policies to incentivize sustainable agriculture.The declaration also reaffirmed the alignment of financial flows with international goals to reverse forest loss and degradation.Reaffirming international financial commitments and significantly increasing finance and investment from a wide variety of public and private sources, while also improving its effectiveness and accessibility, to enable sustainable agriculture, sustainable forest management, forest conservation and restoration, and support for Indigenous Peoples and local communities, are also among the action areas in the Declaration.On November 2, Johnson announced that over 100 countries, including China, Russia and Brazil, had signed the Leaders' Declaration. The Philippines was also among the countries in the list.Dominguez on November 1 affirmed the Philippines' support to the Declaration during a meeting with Richard Graham, member of Parliament for Gloucester, and the UK Prime Minister's Trade Envoy to the Asean Economic Community.Graham also discussed with Dominguez the issue of green finance and the Philippines' initiatives to combat climate change during the meeting.Dominguez cited the importance of the ""blended approach"" or the sustainable orchestration of grants, investments and subsidies to make climate finance work for its beneficiaries.""It is important that we have a clear definition of what constitutes climate finance. Climate finance, I believe, should aspire for a sustainable orchestration of the three elements of grants, investments and subsidies,"" Dominguez said.This blended approach, he noted, should be at the heart of climate finance. Because this money is raised from investors and taxpayers, accountability and openness are essential. Beneficiary countries must regularly reassure their donors, taxpayers and investors that their funds are being wisely spent.Dominguez said the Philippines is adamant that those who have generated and continue to emit the most amount of greenhouse gases pay the greatest financial burden in the transition to carbon neutrality.""The Philippines, however, will not wait for Western nations to get their act together. Climate change is here. It's happening. We are moving ahead with the implementation of actual projects on the ground to enable us to meet our commitments,"" he said.""The Philippines is determined to move ahead even as other countries hesitate to meet their commitments,"" the Finance chief added.",Copyright 2021 The Manila Times All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|CONVENTION ON BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY|DEFORESTATIONCONSERVATIONECOLOGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCEENVIRONMENTAL TREATIES & AGREEMENTSFORESTRY & ENVIRONMENTFORESTS & WOODLANDSINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS & NATIONAL SECURITYLAND DEGRADATIONSTATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICESSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALSSUSTAINABLE FORESTRYUNITED NATIONSCLIMATE CHANGEFOREST RESOURCES MANAGEMENTSUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURESUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTCLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION & POLICYAGREEMENTSBIODIVERSITYENVIRONMENTAL & WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONSFORESTRY SERVICESGLOBAL WARMINGINTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTLAND RECLAMATIONLAND USE & DEVELOPMENTLAND USE PLANNINGNEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSPLANT CONSERVATIONPUBLIC POLICYUNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONSHEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENTPRIME MINISTERSECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTPUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES & TREASURIESENVIRONMENTAL RELATED SERVICESSUSTAINABILITYINDIGENOUS PEOPLESNEGATIVE NEWSBUSINESS NEWSFOOD SECURITYTREATIES & AGREEMENTSEMISSIONSAGRICULTURE REGULATION & POLICYENVIRONMENTAL ACCIDENTS & DISASTERSPOVERTY & HOMELESSNESSDESERTS|DEFORESTATIONFORESTRY & ENVIRONMENTSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALSSUSTAINABLE FORESTRYFOREST RESOURCES MANAGEMENTSUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURESUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTAGRICULTUREFORESTRY SERVICESGLOBAL WARMINGLAND USE PLANNINGPUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES & TREASURIESENVIRONMENTAL RELATED SERVICESEMISSIONSAGRICULTURE REGULATION & POLICY|RODRIGO DUTERTEBORIS JOHNSON|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|PHILIPPINESSCOTLANDUNITED KINGDOM",

332,Plan to deliver Paris climate goals could be agreed this week,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Irish Times,News,450,IRELAND;Pg. 3,450,Ireland,Denis Staunton,,EUROPEAN COMMISSION,EUROPEAN COMMISSIONEUROPEAN UNION,Plan to deliver Paris climate goals could be agreed this week," The rulebook for implementing the 2015 Paris climate agreement could be completed at the Cop26 in Glasgow this week, European Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans has said.He said completing the rulebook, which sets out detailed guidance for how countries must implement the goals agreed in Paris in 2015, would be one of the key outcomes of this week's summit. ""It will allow us to start delivery of what was agreed six years ago in a way that is transparent for everyone and accountable for everyone,"" he told a press conference in Glasgow. ""I think there is a positive dynamic, and I see a growing sense among fellow leaders that we need to find agreement. We in the European Union continue to work to keep the momentum going and hopefully drive it to the highest possible level of ambition."" Most of the rulebook has been agreed since 2018 but a number of key issues remain unresolved, notably on the regulation of carbon markets where emissions are traded. Completing the rulebook would be a major success for Cop26, which is due to end by 6pm today but Mr Timmermans warned it would be a ""very bad signal"" if a reference to phasing out coal and fossil fuels in a draft text published on Wednesday does not survive in the summit's final statement . ""It took the world a while to understand. I remember even some of our member-states only a couple of years ago saying coal is forever. And now every member state of European Union knows that there is no future in coal. ""I think the sense of urgency has increased and the understanding that fossil fuels are part of the problem has increased. But if you remove it from the text, what is the message you're sending then? Because the only way humanity can learn to live within planetary boundaries is if we rid ourselves of the dependency on fossil fuels that are making our survival impossible,"" he said. The EU has faced charges of hypocrisy over its investment in dozens of gas infrastructure projects at the same time that it is calling in Glasgow for an end to fossil fuels. But Mr Timmermans said the EU had nothing to be ashamed of and asserted that its investment in gas infrastructure helped to prepare for a future beyond fossil fuels. ""Exiting out of coal for a number of our member-states will have to happen through an intermediary phase of using natural gas to lead these countries to using fossil-free energy. That is reality. Now, what we need to do with our investments is to make sure that the investments in the infrastructure that will be needed for natural gas are pre-fitted to also be able to carry decarbonated or green gases so that the density of different gases can be transported through this infrastructure,"" he said.",Copyright 2021 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|EUROPEAN COMMISSIONEUROPEAN UNION|AGREEMENTSCLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION & POLICYEUROPEAN UNION INSTITUTIONSEUROPEAN UNIONINTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONSEMISSIONSPRESS CONFERENCES|ENERGY & UTILITIESNATURAL GAS PRODUCTSNATURAL GASEMISSIONSTRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|EUROPEEUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATESFRANCEIRELAND",
333,Political climate change: Realities behind Xi's peace initiative,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Daily Mirror (Sri Lanka),News,1111,,1111,"Sri Lanka, Democratic Socialist Republic of",,,,,Political climate change: Realities behind Xi's peace initiative,"Sri Lanka, Nov. 12 -- Cooperation, not Cold War, is what the world urgently needs to overcome multiple crises of gargantuan proportions, with the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change and the global economic downturn being the most pressing issues.It is heartening to note that world leaders do speak of the gravity of these problems and call for concerted global efforts to find solutions to these burning issues. Yet their call for cooperation appears to stop at lip level. Their concerns over threats to humanity dissipate after they come out of global conferences such as the ongoing COP26 climate talks and walk into high-octane security rooms for national security talks.Theoretically speaking, nations pursuing power politics will not hesitate to weaponize the pandemic and even climate change to cause the downfall of their rivals. Perhaps, what prevents them from doing so is the realization that pandemics and climate change are no respecters of borders. They teach us a vital lesson for co-existence. We need to swim together to save humanity, as the school of small fish caught in the net saved themselves in the computer-animated adventure movie 'Finding Nemo'.The latest call for cooperation between rival powers came on Tuesday from China's President Xi Jinping, who is well on his way to become a Mao Zedong-like leader. It came a week before a virtual summit between Xi and US President Joe Biden, while the countries they lead are embroiled in a slew of disputes, some of which could trigger the next world war. The two leaders have not met since Biden took office.President Xi's message of cooperation came in a recorded video message to a business forum on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in New Zealand. The message preceded an agreement between China and the United States to set up a working group to tackle climate change in the short term and a promise to meet regularly to address the crisis.""Right now, China-US relations are at a critical historical juncture. Both countries will gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation,"" Xi told the APEC forum, insisting that cooperation was the only right choice.""China stands ready to work with the US to enhance exchanges and cooperation across the board, jointly address regional and international issues as well as global challenges and, in the meantime, properly manage differences,"" Xi said.As often seen, the world leaders' words are seldom turned into action. This is because power politics they pursue is all about one-upmanship.The United States has, in recent months, upped the ante vis-a-vis China. Together with the United Kingdom, the US signed a deal with Australia to strengthen Canberra's nuclear submarine capabilities. That the deal known as AUKUS is targeted at China is no big secret. Also the US is taking measures to institutionalize the informal Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or the Quad comprising, apart from the US, India, Japan and Australia. The Quad leaders had a summit on the sidelines of the recent United Nations General Assembly sessions in New York and the security cooperation the Quad envisages covers the entire Indo-Pacific region. The term Indo-Pacific region gained geopolitical currency only in the past decade or so, after the US succeeded in wooing India, giving it equal leadership role to check China's attempts to dominate the Indian Ocean region, especially the South Asian sea area.In the meantime, China has increased its assertive diplomacy and aggressive manouevres in the South China Sea region. In recent weeks china made a record number of incursions near Taiwan which it insists is part of China, while modernizing its nuclear arsenal and military capabilities.Although President Xi in his message to the APEC forum called on the US not to create a Cold War like tension in the Asia-Pacific region, the ground realities indicate that the two countries are already carrying out hybrid warfare targeting each other. Hybrid warfare, an emerging but ill-defined notion in conflict studies, refers to a multi-domain conflict approach, with a calculated use of conventional and non-conventional means to disrupt and disable an opponent's actions without engaging in open hostilities. The Cold War that existed between the US and the Soviet Union was also similar to hybrid warfare between China and the US, the exception being that the Cold War rivals fought many wars through proxies while continuing their campaign to spread their political and socio-economic ideologies.Be it hybrid warfare or cold war, the assumption that nuclear powers do not go for all-out war gives some assurance to the people of Asia that they need not worry too much about the Third World War happening in their midst.However, Asia's people, especially those in countries vulnerable to big power manipulation, have already become victims of the power-politics or the games the big powers play in the Indo-Pacific region.Cold War like tension or hybrid warfare certainly increases the defence expenditure of those nations that pursue power political ambitions. At a time when the COVID-19 pandemic is ravaging people's lives, especially those in poor countries, money spent on buying or developing sophisticated killer weapons should be diverted towards helping poor nations to buy vaccines.While most rich countries have achieved full vaccination targets, more than 50 poor countries have vaccinated less than 25 percent of their people. The countries with the lowest incomes generally have the lowest Covid-19 vaccination rates. The rich poor gap is killing thousands of unvaccinated people in poor nations.The China-US cooperation moves as seen in yesterday's COP26 consensus should be extended to South Asia and other regions. While China calls on the US to take steps to defuse tension in the Asia-Pacific region, there should be Sino-Indian cooperation talks to bring about South Asia's dream of making the Indian Ocean a zone of peace.If India and China can become partners in BRICS, and work as members in the Beijing-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, there is no reason why they cannot become partners in an initiative to make the Indian-Ocean a peace zone and solve their border disputes amicably. The fact that trade between India and China has now reached US$ 100 billion should be a harbinger for peace.Forget the Quad, which is not a confidence-building measure for the Indian Ocean peace zone.Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

It will also encourage knowledge sharing on emission reduction strategies, climate finance, and climate adaptation.The UPU already supports carbon reporting across the postal sector through its Online Solution for Carbon Analysis and Reporting (OSCAR).The COP26 Climate Change Conference, which has entered its second week of talks in Glasgow, Scotland, has focused the world's attention on the road to net zero.'The resolution puts us in a strong position at a time when governments are gathering in Glasgow for the COP26 Summit, and a key issue that is going to be discussed is climate finance. This is a huge opportunity for the postal sector because collectively if we work together, we can access funding for infrastructure improvements, particularly infrastructure that is a climate-resilient and low carbon,' Hale added.",Copyright 2021 The Balochistan Times All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|English US|ISLAMABAD|Pakistan|ENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCESPOLLUTION & ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTSCLIMATE CHANGEEMISSIONSSUSTAINABILITYSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTGREEN FINANCECONFERENCES & CONVENTIONSENVIRONMENTALISMSOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE & LIFESTYLEAIR QUALITY REGULATIONENVIRONMENTAL ENFORCEMENTGREENHOUSE GASESINVESTIGATIONSECONOMICS|EMISSIONSSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTGREEN FINANCE|GLASGOW, SCOTLANDISLAMABAD, PAKISTAN|PAKISTANSCOTLAND",

The Last Post was played before a single-gun salute fired at 11am and again, two minutes later, marking the start and end of the silence.Wreaths were laid by the Deputy Lord Provost of Edinburgh and representatives from Royal British Legion Scotland, Poppy Scotland and Veterans Scotland.At the ceremony - which also marked the centenary of the Royal British Legion Scotland - Deputy Lord Provost Joan Griffiths said: 'Today is to mark and to remember all those young men and women who sacrificed their lives so that we could have a future.'Yes, we remember the Great War and the Second World War, but there has been conflict almost every year since, and it's been young men and women who have gone out to these areas and sacrificed their lives or become injured and have life-changing injuries. It's so important that we remember them and don't forget them.'Following the service, veterans and members of the public were able to lay poppies in the Garden of Remembrance.Veteran Scotland general secretary Jim Wilson, who served in both the regular and Territorial Army, attended the wreath-laying with fellow veterans.'It's really important to have the opportunity to remember,' he said, 'and Remembrance provides that opportunity whether people come for the event itself or come for a moment's quiet reflection on their own at some later stage.'It's important these opportunities are here because it does make a difference for people to step back and think about the sacrifices that people have made, both during the Great War, Second World War and all of the conflicts beyond.'Eddie Maley, who served with theQueen's Own Highlanders in Northern Ireland in 1973 and 1974, attended to remember fallen comrades and his father.He said: 'It's a privilege and a duty to be here to remember them. People are here to celebrate Armistice Day, and we're here because of these people. We need to start educating our children about the past conflicts and how horrible war is; we should never, ever forget.'The Duchess of Cornwall also laid a cross amid the poppies at the Field of Remembrance outside Westminster Abbey.In Glasgow, a two-minute silence was observed at the UK Pavilion at Cop26 in Glasgow. Cop26 president Alok Sharma, First Minister NicolaSturgeon and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres were among those marking the occasion.Holyrood's Presiding Officer, Alison Johnstone, led a two-minute silence in the Scottish parliament alongside opposition leaders and Deputy First Minister John Swinney.Elsewhere, an Aberdeenshire town has constructed a stunning display to mark the centenary of the poppy's significance.Macduff's town cross and anchor has been showered with 13,000 hand-knitted poppies marking the return of its famous display for the first time in two years.The sea of red - at a spot across from Macduff Parish Church and also at the entrance of the town's cemetery - was first unveiled in 2018 before going on to become an annual spectacle.Veterans and members of the public also paid their respects at a ceremony at George Square in Glasgow and another at Central Station.In Aberdeen, people gathered outside Cowdray Hall at 11am for the two minutes of silence.The Last Post was played as members of the public in Inverness stood motionless.The 104-year-old Flanders poppy A POPPY picked from the fields of Flanders by a Scot who survived the First World War has been cherished by his family for 104 years.Alfred Ross left Glenogil, Angus, aged 25 to fight with the Black Watch in Belgium.Amid shelling and gunfire, he picked a Flanders poppy and sent it to his mother in 1917.He later treasured the poppy he had mailed home, keeping it inside his Bible until he passed away in 1968, aged 76.It is now with great-grandson Ross Thomson, 45, of Montrose who said it is 'a treasure you simply couldn't put a price on'.'Remember all those who sacrificed their lives'",Copyright 2021 Associated Newpapers Ltd.

It's so important that we remember them and don't forget them.'Following the service, veterans and members of the public were able to lay poppies in the Garden of Remembrance.Veteran Scotland general secretary Jim Wilson, who served in both the regular and Territorial Army, attended the wreath-laying with fellow veterans.'It's really important to have the opportunity to remember,' he said, 'and Remembrance provides that opportunity whether people come for the event itself or come for a moment's quiet reflection on their own at some later stage.'It's important these opportunities are here because it does make a difference for people to step back and think about the sacrifices that people have made, both during the Great War, Second World War and all of the conflicts beyond.'Eddie Maley, who served with theQueen's Own Highlanders in Northern Ireland in 1973 and 1974, attended to remember fallen comrades and his father.He said: 'It's a privilege and a duty to be here to remember them. People are here to celebrate Armistice Day, and we're here because of these people. We need to start educating our children about the past conflicts and how horrible war is; we should never, ever forget.'The Duchess of Cornwall also laid a cross amid the poppies at the Field of Remembrance outside Westminster Abbey.In Glasgow, a two-minute silence was observed at the UK Pavilion at Cop26 in Glasgow. Cop26 president Alok Sharma, First Minister NicolaSturgeon and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres were among those marking the occasion.Holyrood's Presiding Officer, Alison Johnstone, led a two-minute silence in the Scottish parliament alongside opposition leaders and Deputy First Minister John Swinney.Elsewhere, an Aberdeenshire town has constructed a stunning display to mark the centenary of the poppy's significance.Macduff's town cross and anchor has been showered with 13,000 hand-knitted poppies marking the return of its famous display for the first time in two years.The sea of red - at a spot across from Macduff Parish Church and also at the entrance of the town's cemetery - was first unveiled in 2018 before going on to become an annual spectacle.Veterans and members of the public also paid their respects at a ceremony at George Square inGlasgow and another at Central Station.In Aberdeen, people gathered outside Cowdray Hall at 11am for the two minutes of silence.The Last Post was played as members of the public in Inverness stood motionless.The 104-year-old Flanders poppyA POPPY picked from the fields of Flanders by a Scot who survived the First World War has been cherished by his family for 104 years.Alfred Ross left Glenogil, Angus, aged 25 to fight with the Black Watch in Belgium.Amid shelling and gunfire, he picked a Flanders poppy and sent it to his mother in 1917.He later treasured the poppy he had mailed home, keeping it inside his Bible until he passed away in 1968, aged 76.It is now with great-grandson Ross Thomson, 45, of Montrose who said it is 'a treasure you simply couldn't put a price on'.'Remember all those who sacrificed their lives'",Copyright 2021 Associated Newpapers Ltd.

338,Solve climate change?; We can't even address the current threats to human life,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,National Post (f/k/a The Financial Post)(Canada),News,1274,IDEAS;Pg. A9,1274,Canada,Terry GlavinNational Post,,,,Solve climate change?; We can't even address the current threats to human life,"Cynicism will come easily in any serious evaluation of the prospects for the COP26 jamboree in Glasgow mitigating the worst climate effects of humanity's overloading of carbon from greenhouse gases into the planet's upper stratosphere. But that cynicism isn't necessarily warranted by the contradictions arising from the conference itself.Never mind for the moment the 400 private planes that carried celebrities, politicians, diplomats and bureaucrats to that great and grey Scottish city - among them 300 delegates from Canada - or the gigajoules of energy burned in the ferrying of 40,000 people to Scotland to engage in the nearly two weeks of conventioneering, guerrilla-theatre street protests and hullabaloos that are set to conclude Friday.After all, a radical restructuring of the global economy will be required to hold the planet's average temperature to the 2015 Paris Agreement's target of less than two degrees above pre-industrial levels, and preferably something closer to 1.5 degrees, in order just to stave of a cascade of ecological disasters. And it's all to the good that western countries are expending so much emotional, intellectual and political capital to the purpose of achieving that objective.But where things start to fall down is the Horn of Africa, Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria and other hellscapes where the United Nations World Food Program reckons that 690 million people already go to bed on an empty stomach every night, and 45 million people are now teetering directly on the abyss of famine. That's up from 42 million last year, owing solely to the American-led surrender to the savagery of the Taliban. The Afghan economy has collapsed, and the people have been reduced to selling their daughters to keep them alive.The democratic developed world cannot muster sufficient resolve to prevent hereand-now catastrophes - let alone the climate mayhem forecast in all the standard models - in Ethiopia, Myanmar, Liberia, Lebanon, Sudan, the Central African Republic and at least a dozen other countries where ordinary life is coming apart at the seams. What faith are we expected to have that the international community is up to the job of controlling the future temperature of the planet? The NATO capitals'anxieties are not misplaced over the spectre of millions of climate refugees fleeing Latin America, South Asia and Africa in the coming years. But already, the world's refugee population stands at 82.4 million. The United Nations Refugee Agency counts nearly 50 million ""internally displaced"" people around the world. The ranks of the global homeless are swelling, and resettling them all in the industrialized world doesn't exactly solve the problems that drove them from their homes in the first place.The Norwegian Refugee Council estimates that in the weeks since the return of the Taliban, roughly 300,000 Afghans have fled into Iran, and their numbers are rising by as many as 5,000 people every day. In what the European Commission has described as a ""gangster-style"" strategy to destabilize Europe, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarus dictator Alexander Lukashenko are luring Syrian, Iraqi and Afghan refugees to Minsk, where they are then dispatched by the thousands under army escort to the borders of Poland, Latvia and Lithuania. This week alone, at least 4,000 more refugees were massed at fences along the Polish border.Ethiopia's year-long civil war has produced mass atrocities committed by all sides - primarily by the Ethiopian military headquartered in Addis Ababa, but also by the Tigray People's Liberation Front and forces with the Eritrean police state, run by strongman President Isaias Afwerki. Last week, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed vowed: ""We will bury this enemy with our blood and bones and make the glory of Ethiopia high again.""The carnage has already driven tens of thousands of refugees into northern Kenya, where Hassan Khannenje of the Nairobi-based Institute for Strategic Studies foresees ""a likelihood (of) hundreds of thousands, if not millions of refugees,"" if the world allows the conflict to continue.On the United States-Mexico border, meanwhile, while this year's numbers appear down from last year, illegal migration is chronic. The Migration Policy Institute counts about 540,000 ""successful unlawful entries"" into the U.S. from the Mexican side this year, mostly families and unaccompanied minors from Central America.This is where COP26 cynicism reasonably sets in, with blank stares answering this simple question: If the civilized world can't cope with the forces underlying these miseries right now, why should we vest any confidence in the high-minded pledges elicited from the politicians assembled in Glasgow? It's been 12 years since the Copenhagen climate summit, when the world's wealthier countries solemnly pledged to spend $100 million every year to help the world's ""developing"" countries undergo the shift to clean energy and low-carbon industrial production and implement climate-change mitigation measures. And here we are, 12 years later, and not a single year has passed with that target being met.Among the unresolved issues: How huge is the annual shortfall, exactly? The international aid organization Oxfam says the cumulative shortfall over the past few years amounts to between $68 billion and $75 billion. But what's the proper distribution between grants and loan financing? How is the bill to be split among the developed-world countries? Who gets the money, exactly? Do we all just write a blank cheque to mass murderers like Syrian President Bashar Assad, who has barrel-bombed half his country's population into refugees and ""internally displaced"" people? Should we deduct the costs of the food aid he's stolen from the UN from the amount his government would claim as Syria's entitlement? It's not as though there aren't effective ways to address the threats posed by climate change - not least a shift from coal and oil to natural gas, nuclear and renewable energy, along with retrofitting cities and transportation infrastructure, restoring the health of carbon-sequestering ecosystems and reforestation. And it's not as though there isn't a public appetite for these measures across Europe and North America, historically the largest contributors to global warming.But where things really fall down is in the People's Republic of China, which was barely present at all in Glasgow. While greenhouse gas emissions have largely flatlined in Europe, Japan and North America over the past 20 years, China's emissions, which overtook United States'levels more than a decade ago, have more than doubled. Chinese supreme leader Xi Jinping is doubling down on domestic coal production, insisting that China deserves to be cut the same slack as any impoverished ""developing country.""Beijing used that dodge to justify its refusal to make commitments under the historic Kyoto Protocol in 1997, and it's still insisting that the world owes China - the world's biggest greenhouse-gas producer - the same allowances. Europe's emissions peaked in 1979. The United States'emissions peaked in 2007. The Xi regime proposes that it will not reach peak emissions until 2030, and doesn't plan to be ""carbon neutral"" until 2060 - a decade later than other industrialized countries. Meanwhile, Canada's total contribution to global emissions amounts to about 1.5 per cent.So, if you insist on being cynical about the goings-on in Glasgow, be cynical about that.National Post The big issues are far from settled.

Although she has no role in the negotiations at the Glasgow summit, which is being hosted by the UK Government, she has made a series of speeches calling for radical action and met a number of world leaders, including Joe Biden, the US President, at a drinks reception.However, Greenpeace accused her of sitting on the fence over the controversial Cambo oil field off Shetland after she urged Boris Johnson to review its drilling licence while repeatedly refusing to state whether she personally opposed the development.She has said unlimited oil and gas extraction from the North Sea would be wrong but yesterday warned this must be achieved without leaving ""the 100,000 people currently working in oil and gas on the economic scrapheap"".France, Greenland, Ireland, Sweden, Wales and the Canadian province of Quebec announced they had joined Boga, which was formed in September. However, no major oil-producing nations signed up.The group's ""core members"" commit to ""end new concessions, licensing or leasing rounds for oil and gas production and exploration"" and to set a date for totally ending drilling, aligned with the Paris climate change agreement.Countries can become secondtier ""associate"" members if they have taken some steps to limit oil and gas output, such as ending public financing of it abroad, or reforming fossil fuel subsidies.",Copyright 2021 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|DTL|ENGLISH|SEA LTD|FRIENDS OF THE EARTH|NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING & BROADCASTING & WEB SEARCH PORTALS|SE (NYSE)|Scotland|NEGATIVE NEWSNEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWSENVIRONMENTAL & WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONSCLIMATE CHANGEEMISSIONSENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGYENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRYENVIRONMENTALISMUS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016GREENHOUSE GASESBUSINESS & PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONSCONFERENCES & CONVENTIONSENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICESUSTAINABILITYUS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020|OIL EXTRACTIONENERGY & UTILITIESOIL & GAS INDUSTRYEMISSIONSENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRYMINING & EXTRACTION RIGHTS & ROYALTIESNATURAL GAS EXTRACTIONMEDIA & TELECOMMUNICATIONS|GRETA THUNBERGBORIS JOHNSONJOE BIDENNICOLA STURGEON|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|ATLANTIC OCEANNORTH SEAQUEBEC, CANADA|SCOTLANDUNITED KINGDOMCANADAFRANCEGREENLANDWALES",SE (NYSE)

342,Swinney is a nightmare before Christmas,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Herald (Glasgow),News,670,Pg. 17,670,Scotland,Garry Scott ,,,,Swinney is a nightmare before Christmas,"HERE we go again. Even before Glasgow's overflowing bins have been emptied, its rats exterminated and the pampered COP26 delegates have had a chance to use their free bus pass, Holyrood's Ministry of Truth pre-festive peddling of fear, uncertainty and distortion of facts over Covid is under way.The nightmares before Christmas have started, with our doom-mongering Grinch, Deputy First Minister John Swinney, terrifying our nation in the Scottish Parliament with apocalyptic visions of Covid calamities. He warned that, as a pre-emptive measure to ""Save Christmas"", the Government is considering extending its contentious, business-bursting vaccine passports to pubs, restaurants, cafes, and leisure venues.He said: ""We need to take appropriate measures to keep the pandemic under control ... it is because we want to avoid more difficult restrictions that we cannot rule out strengthening the baseline measures currently in place as the best way to head off any prospect of future lockdowns. We have been considering, for example, whether we may need to extend the Covid certification scheme to bring more settings into scope, such as indoor hospitality and leisure settings.""In other words, a total rollout of this discriminatory scheme. This is something we had previously been assured would not happen and comes straight off the back of his shocking admission at last week's cross-party Covid-19 Committee that his Government cannot produce any evidence to support the introduction of vaccination passports or prove that they reduce the spread of coronavirus. Incredibly, he stated that it is ""impossible to segment data to determine if it is working"" but that he ""believes"" it is delivering a positive benefit. The Scottish Government is guilty of making policies up on the hoof, with mandatory rules which curtail our freedoms and restrict our movements on an ill-informed hunch. It cannot produce any evidence to support this iniquitous and discriminatory measure because quite simply there isn't any. There is, however, plenty of tangible evidence available, if they only cared to look, that shows the catastrophic impact vaccine passports have already had on the ailing night-time economy and live music industry. Some desperate operators and venues are reporting a gut-wrenching drop in footfall of up to 60 per cent and no-shows hovering around the 25% mark. Not the cynical and misleading figures of 10-20% that our pumped-up, unelected public health chief Jason Leitch has been banding about.There is an abundance of data which supports claims that, as a public health measure, vaccination passports are useless - they don't save lives and do nothing to stop the virus from spreading. The medical journal The Lancet recently reported that fully-vaccinated individuals with infections have peak viral loads similar to unvaccinated cases and can easily transmit infection.Yet here we are again being warned by our ""have a hunch"" Covid Recovery Cabinet Secretary, oh the irony, that he has reasons to suspect cases will rise, not least because of an influx of visitors during COP26, an event which should have been rescheduled if deemed a public health hazard.Swinney said that in order to Save Christmas and our badly-resourced NHS, which was needing saving long before Covid, stricter rules for face coverings as well as a wider use of the discredited vaccine passport scheme might come into force. In Swinney newspeak, this means they will.These crippling measures could destroy Scotland's wider hospitality and retail sectors. As Liz Cameron of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce warned, they ""risk derailing our economic growth"". A discredited scheme which our FM Nicola Sturgeon once said she would not support because it deepened social inequalities and took away people's liberties. But now, with her battalion of obedient parliamentary elves, she is intent on rail-roading this through Parliament, regardless of the division, disruption, and damage it causes.Save Christmas?

""It's a battle we need to win.""Wednesday's summit warned that Yorkshire is currently on target to use its share of the global carbon budget in the next six years. Beyond that, the region will begin to contribute enough emissions to take global temperature rises above 1.5 degrees C.""Our response to climate change needs to be something that's done by us and for us - not to us,"" added Ms Brabin.She is leading a campaign for an extra £85m for West Yorkshire to invest in green technology and to drastically improve air quality.""I have some powers as the mayor, but I also need support from government so they can hit their target of 2050 - and we can help them on their way,"" said Ms Brabin.""Levelling up and the climate emergency are both sides of the same coin. We need that resource to deal with climate change.""Roughly one in 20 deaths across the country are linked to poor air quality and the Yorkshire & Humber Climate Commission have said more needs to be done ""urgently"" to stop global temperatures rising.Professor Piers Forster, director of the Priestley International Centre for Climate, is at COP26 negotiating with world leaders on how to reduce emissions, but he spoke virtually at yesterday's summit to hammer home just how urgent the climate crisis is.""It can sound really frightening and urgent - and that is why it's really important to do something about it and set more ambitious targets,"" he said.""We have to reduce emissions by 50 per cent over the next 10 years. We have to get to net zero.""While Ms Brabin said she would demand the extra cash from government, she was highly critical of their recent actions.At last month's budget, chancellor Rishi Sunak made it cheaper to fly between Britain's airports. Just a few days later, prime minister Boris Johnson took a private jet back from the COP26 summit in Glasgow so that he could have dinner at a men-only private members' club in London.Ms Brabin said: ""It's absurd that you have a government talking green and then making it cheaper for their colleagues to fly between airports across the UK.""The two don't seem to go together.

345,Trade officials 'taking a chainsaw' to EU forest protection plans,"November 12, 2021 Friday",Non-jurisdictional,The Guardian (London),News,648,WORLD NEWS;Version:1,648,,Jennifer Rankin in Brussels,,EUROPEAN COMMISSION,EUROPEAN COMMISSION,Trade officials 'taking a chainsaw' to EU forest protection plans,"European trade officials have been accused of ""taking a chainsaw"" to a draft EU law to protect the world's forests, as a leaked document revealed an attempt to water down the plans.The European Commission is due to unveil a proposal  on Wednesday to prevent EU sales of beef, soy, cocoa and other products linked to deforestation. A leaked memo seen by the Guardian reveals that commission trade officials have raised ""serious concerns"" about the regulation drafted by their environment department colleagues.Last week the European commissioner for trade, Valdis Dombrovskis, told delegates at Cop26  that trade policy ""must do more to help us achieve our global climate targets"", referencing the upcoming anti-deforestation law. The EU joined the US, China and other major forested countries including Brazil and the Democratic Republic of the Congo in a voluntary declaration in Glasgow  to halt and reverse the felling of forests.To help make this promise a reality, the EU is proposing to prevent beef, palm oil and other commodities driving deforestation from being sold in its market. In a departure from past EU laws, the commission proposed to regulate products linked to all deforestation, legal or illegal, according to an earlier leaked draft.  Previous laws have sought to clamp down on illegal deforestation only.Trade officials have attempted to throw out that provision, arguing that it would be ""a direct challenge to notions of sovereignty over land use decisions, whether in the EU or in third countries."" The memo says targeting all deforestation ""will be particularly difficult to accept"" in forested countries, including Brazil whose president, Jair Bolsonaro, disputes the notion  that forests are a global public good. Refocusing the law on illegal deforestation would bring the EU into line with the US and UK, who are considering narrower laws, the officials add.The trade officials also say the costs of complying with the EU law would hurt subsistence-level farmers, and warn of retaliation by foreign governments through the World Trade Organization.In another move to limit the regulation, they argue that the law should be limited to deforestation rather than forest degradation, citing the absence of international definitions on the latter which they say would make the law hard to enforce.""Combined with the absence of international standards, [including forest degradation] poses serious policy and legal concerns and we consider it a risky avenue to try to justify this on the basis of public morals,"" the memo states.That move will disappoint environmental campaigners, who this week wrote to the commission urging broad protection of all threatened ecosystems. ""Not only is forest degradation a precursor for deforestation, it also fuels climate change and biodiversity loss, as degraded ecosystems lose their capacity to provide essential services to nature and people, such as carbon storage,"" said the letter  by a coalition of more than 55 non-governmental organisations.Environmentalists point to the work being done by the EU's scientific arm, the Joint Research Centre, to define international standards of forest degradation, arguing that it would be possible to come up with a working definition of forest degradation.Sini Eräjää, of Greenpeace, one of the signatory organisations, called on the commission to ensure that all deforestation, legal or not, was covered by the law.

346,Ugandan activist finds her voice and spot in the picture,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Globe and Mail (Canada),News,780,NEWS;Pg. A4,780,Canada,PAUL WALDIE,,WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM,WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM,Ugandan activist finds her voice and spot in the picture,"LeadIt was on a cold January day in Switzerland last year when Vanessa Nakate found her true voice.Ms. Nakate had just attended a press conference at the World Economic Forum in Davos with Greta Thunberg and three other young environmental activists.Texte/TextShe'd spoken about the damaging effects of climate change on her homeland of Uganda and across Africa. As she scrolled through her phone a few hours later, she came across a news story about the press conference, and her heart sank.An Associated Press photograph accompanying the article showed Ms. Thunberg and three of the other activists, all white Europeans. Ms. Nakate had been in the shot as well - part of her coat was barely visible in the photograph - but she'd been cropped out of the frame.""It was like the hardest thing because everyone's message was being talked about and my message was left out,"" she said in a tearful video posted later that day on Twitter. ""Does that mean I have no value as an activist or the people from Africa don't have any value at all?"" The news agency later apologized and released the full photograph, but the episode sparked a worldwide outcry and it transformed Ms. Nakate into a climate-crusading superstar who now rivals Ms. Thunberg for global attention.Since the Davos debacle, Ms. Nakate, 24, has been invited to speak at conferences around the world and she's launched the Rise Up Movement to encourage climate activism in Africa. She's also been interviewed by actor Angelina Jolie, made the cover of Time magazine, and written a bestselling book appropriately titled, A Bigger Picture: My Fight To Bring A New African Voice To The Climate Crisis.""Being cropped out of the photo changed the course of my activism and my life,"" she wrote in the opening chapter. ""It reframed my thoughts about race, gender, equality and climate justice.""On Thursday, Ms. Nakate shared the stage at the COP26 climate summit with Antonio Guterres, the Secretary-General of the United Nations. With a steady voice, she delivered a passionate plea that drew sustained applause.""We see business leaders and investors flying into COP on private jets. We see them making fancy speeches. We hear about new pledges and promises,"" she told the delegates. ""I have come here to tell you that we don't believe you.""And in a direct pitch to business leaders she added: ""Show us your faithfulness, show us your trustworthiness, show us your honesty. I am here to say, prove us wrong.""Ms. Nakate has been a forceful voice throughout the summit, both inside the conference centre and on the streets of Glasgow.While Ms. Thunberg was given no role at COP26, Ms. Nakate has participated in two panel discussions, including one with actor Idris Elba.She's also been at the forefront of a pair of massive protest marches through the city's streets and she's headlined two rallies.It's a far cry from her youth in Kampala, where Ms. Nakate was a shy, bookish child who went on to earn a business degree at Makerere University.As a college student she'd been interested in environmental issues and worried about the prolonged droughts and searing heat waves that had hit much of the continent. But she never dreamed of taking a public stand on the issue.That changed in 2018, when she saw news reports about Ms. Thunberg's climate strike in front of the Swedish parliament. In her book, Ms. Nakate said she was impressed by the Swede's commitment and she decided to hold a similar strike in downtown Kampala - a nerve-racking experience in a society that has strict norms about what women should and shouldn't do. She uploaded some pictures of her sit-in on Twitter, which Ms. Thunberg quickly retweeted. The photos went viral and Ms. Nakate soon found herself part of Ms. Thunberg's growing movement called Fridays for Future.She remains one of the few young climate activists from Africa and has a passion that world leaders find hard to ignore. Despite her prominence, the same problem she encountered in Davos surfaced again in Glasgow.When Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon met Ms. Thunberg and Ms. Nakate at the start of the summit, some news photographs of the meeting cut out Ms. Nakate and only showed Ms. Sturgeon and Ms. Thunberg. That drew a sharp rebuke from Ms. Thunberg, who tweeted: ""Media needs to stop erasing the voices of activists.""Once again, more apologies and clarifications ensued.For teenagers such as Anna Brown, Ms. Nakate is an inspiration.""Vanessa is an amazing person,"" said Ms. Brown, 19, who belongs to Fridays for Future in Glasgow. ""Everyone who hears her speak can really feel what she's saying. And I think a lot of the time she's very much a wakeup call for people.""",Copyright 2021 All material copyright The Globe and Mail or its licensors.

Asked during a seminar today at University College London's Constitution Unit whether the PM's claim was justified, Lord Evans replied: ""I don't think we are a corrupt country in the way that some countries are. I think we have a pretty good international reputation for our lack of corruption.""But what I think is important is to recognise that that is not a happy chance of history or something distinctive about the British personality. That is a result of political decisions that have been made over generations.""We could become a corrupt country if we don't attend to ensuring that we maintain standards.""We need to ensure in each generation that we take the decisions that need to be taken.""The risk is that we think it couldn't possibly happen in this country. The fact is it could, and that is why we need to make sure we don't take decisions which would lead us in the wrong direction.""Lord Evans said that the furore of the past week had proved that there was significant public concern about maintaining standards in UK public life.And he said that the rash of sleaze headlines provided an opportunity for the government to say it will adopt the recommendations from a CSPL report, published in 2018, which said that MPs should not be allowed to undertake outside employment as parliamentary strategists, advisers or consultants and that the rules on lobbying should be made clearer.""Standards matter for our democracy,"" said Lord Evans. ""They matter for our economic prosperity and for our international influence and foreign policy.""I am pleased that the government reversed its decision about the Owen Paterson affair but I would like them to do more.""

Formal joining through signing of the framework agreement of the ISA happened during a meeting between India's environment minister Bhupender Yadav and the US special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry at India's delegation office here at the COP26 venue. The meeting took place amid unresolved key issue of finance on table at the COP in the wake of the release of the first draft text. It is learnt that both Yadav and Kerry discussed the issue in detail where the latter spoke about contribution of the US and other developed nations towards climate finance and promised to scale it up further as announcedISA was initiated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and former French President Francois Hollande in 2015. The US entry will also strengthen ISA's recent move to go global through transnational global green grid initiative (GGI) - One Sun One World One Grid (OSOWOG) - which was launched by Modi and his UK counterpart Boris Johnson during the leaders' summit here at COP26 on November 2.Signing the framework agreement, Kerry, said, ""It has long been coming, and we are happy to join the International Solar Alliance, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi took the lead in making.

352,Veteran plots a leaflet campaign over 'forgotten' issue,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Shropshire Star,News,298,NEWS;Pg. 16,298,England & Wales,DAVID TOOLEY,,,,Veteran plots a leaflet campaign over 'forgotten' issue,"A veteran campaigner is dusting off her leaflets once more and is preparing to go into battle again over an untouched angle in the big climate change debate. Daphne Philips, 85, of Ludlow says that not enough attention has been paid to the issue of educating women to control the world's burgeoning human population at the Cop26 conference. Daphne is a veteran of the Greenham Common Peace Camps in Berkshire in the 1980s, when tens of thousands of women joined protests against nuclear weapons. The last missiles left the base in 1991 as a result of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, but the camp remained in place until 2000. ""The issue of the human population has not even been mentioned at Cop26,"" said Daphne, of The Linney. ""One of the solutions is to educate women about their reproductive choices."" Daphne is a supporter of the organisation Population Matters, which counts Sir David Attenborough among its key members. ""The world cannot sustain an ever burgeoning human population in the world,"" she said. ""But this issue of educating women about their reproductive choices is not being talked about in Glasgow."" ""  Daphne counted among her ifluencers Hilda Murrell, the Shropshire rose grower and environmental activist who was famously abducted and murdered in 1984.""Hilda convinced me about the need for restricting families,"" said Daphne. ""But it is not being talked about."" But in some quarters Daphne admits that talk about controlling population is confused with eugenics. But she insists it is nothing of the sort as is for her all about ""the rights of women to have control over our own fertility. She added: ""I am not a member of a group but I feel so strongly about it that now I've had my three jabs I will be on the streets of Ludlow soon with my leaflets.""",Copyright 2021 MNA All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|SHS|ENGLISH|National Edition|CLIMATE CHANGEFEMINISM & WOMEN'S RIGHTSNEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWSWOMENNUCLEAR WEAPONSENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCESMILITARY WEAPONSPROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONSASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONSENVIRONMENTALISM|NUCLEAR WEAPONSMILITARY WEAPONS|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND",

The trip took them from John o' Groats to Glasgow, taking in communities across the north, north-east, Tayside and Fife along the way.Our journalists found that a number of electric charging points which they were relying on were either broken or inaccessible.It was a situation familiar to other drivers trying to adopt greener modes of transport.Wider concerns were raised with Deputy First Minister John Swinney in Holyrood yesterday.In parliament, North East MSP Liam Kerr told him: ""Of those already installed, the number that are faulty now far exceeds those recorded in 2020.""

We will ensure the issues raised here are raised with Charge Place Scotland to ensure we have an effective network.""Speaking after the debate, Mr Kerr said: ""I will be in further dialogue with John Swinney over the issue because the situation is absolutely appalling.""""""

Although the long-term recycling trend is upwards, the amount of rubbish NI councils collect is also growing, up almost 10% since 2012/13.""Unlike the rest of Europe, we're stuck in a waste management time-warp, reliant on landfilling our rubbish or exporting it overseas for someone else to deal with.""Time is running out on these antiquated practices, but we have no suitable alternatives in place.""Arc21 has a credible, 'oven-ready' solution that will help safeguard council services, but it will take time to commission.""To move on from our current precarious position we just need the planning system and ministers to make an evidence-based decision.""The Department for Infrastructure has been asked for a response.

357,WE WILL NEVER FORGET THEM;REMEMBRANCE DAY 2021,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Scottish Express,News,830,"NEWS;Pg. 2,3",830,Scotland,Cyril Dixon,,,,WE WILL NEVER FORGET THEMREMEMBRANCE DAY 2021,"THE Duchess of Cornwall led Britain in silent tribute yesterday as the nation kept its promise to never forget its fallen war heroes.As Camilla represented the Queen at a poignant Westminster Abbey service, towns, cities and villages came to a standstill for two minutes at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month.This year's Remembrance Day was especially important because Covid restrictions prevented most people from paying their respects in 2020.So yesterday's scenes - when hundreds of thousands stopped to pay tribute to the heroes who died for our country - were in stark contrast to the deserted monuments at the height of the pandemic.The Queen, who has been advised to stick to desk duties after her recent health scare, marked the occasion by authorising aides to post a 2004 Remembrance Day photograph of her on Instagram.Her daughter-in-law, Sophie Countess of Wessex, attended an Armistice Service in Bedworth, Warwicks, and laid a wreath at the town's war memorial.And the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester were at a packed service at the National Memorial Arboretum, in Alrewas, Staffs. At the Westminster Abbey service - attended by hundreds of veterans, senior clergy and military top brass - Camilla wore the green of the Rifles. She became a colonel of the regiment after the late Prince Philip passed the honour on to her.The Duchess laid a symbolic floral tribute at the grave of the unknown warrior. Her bouquet included red garden roses for love and devotion, thyme for strength and courage, bay for merit, lavender for protection and rose hips as a symbol of farewell.Last year, she visited the 752-year-old abbey flanked by just a handful of guides.This year, as the UK recovers from Covid, she was in bustling company as she placed a small wooden crucifix on top of a large poppy-covered cross at the abbey's Field of Remembrance.Other dignitaries included Rear Admiral Lionel Jarvis, president of the Poppy Factory, which has been organising the Field of Remembrance since November 1928.What began as just a handful of poppies, grew into the moving modern spectacle, with tens of thousands planted on tributes there every year.Camilla also spent time viewing regimental memorial plots and meeting representatives of the Armed Forces. The Duchess's presence was warmly welcomed by the veterans who had turned out in force.Chelsea pensioner Major Hugo White, 91, said: ""It is very important to have the Duchess here today as she is a member of the Royal Family who we look up to.""Greg Hedges, 56, of the Staffordshire Regiment Association, chatted to Camilla as she stroked his Staffordshire bull terrier mascot, Corporal Watchman VI. The formerWarrant Officer 2nd Class revealed: ""They've met before.""He added: ""It's important to have that representation and to remember those who have died.""Arthur Barty, who was the Queen Mother's driver for 27 years, was representing his former unit - the Black Watch - agreed. He said: ""It's vital we keep this tradition alive of commemorating the fallen.""Peter Fullelove, 88, another Chelsea pensioner and Black Watch veteran, joked: ""I asked if she stopped because she liked the colour of my coat. She said she did.""Camilla also met Alice Wingate Pearce, grand-daughter of Major General Orde Wingate, who founded of the famous Chindits jungle warfare troops.Alice said afterwards: ""It's a great honour to be here, I haven't done this before.""I explained my grandfather's medals to the Duchess and she said, 'Wonderful'.""As more wreaths were laid at the Cenotaph in London, politicians paid their respects. Prime Minister Boris Johnson observed the silence at 10 Downing Street and Labour leader Keir Starmer laid a wreath at London's Euston Station.In Glasgow, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon joined COP26 President Alok Sharma to lead delegates paying tribute at the climate change summit.As Big Ben began to chime, crowds fell silent at railway stations. A Merseyside fire crew stood alongside a giant poppy made of hoses, while wreaths were laid in Glasgow's George Square and at war memorials across the country.They remembered them too on the other side of world. Poppies were projected onto the famous opera house in Sydney,Australia.Thousands also observed the silence in Edinburgh, Cardiff, Belfast and Dublin.In Belfast, First Minister Paul Givan laid a wreath at the City Hall garden of remembrance. In Edinburgh, veterans and government officials gathered at the garden of remembrance, while the silence was ended by a single gun salute from the castle.For one little girl in the city, one-year-old Grace Pettie, yesterday was her first Remembrance Day. But the nation has vowed the tradition will carry on for ever.Jim Wilson, general secretary of Veteran Scotland, said: ""It's really important to have the opportunity to remember.""It does make a difference for people, to step back and think about the sacrifices that people have made during the Great War, WorldWarTwo and all the conflicts beyond.""",Copyright 2021 Express Newspapers All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|DXPscot|ENGLISH|Scotland|BRITISH ROYALTYRELIGIOUS FACILITIESBRITISH NOBILITY & GENTRYCOVID CORONAVIRUSCOVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICYNATIONAL PARKSRETIREMENT & RETIREESCEASEFIRESROYALTY, NOBILITY & GENTRYARMED FORCESDEATH & DYINGTALKS & MEETINGSRELIGIONASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS|BRITISH ROYALTYBRITISH NOBILITY & GENTRYNATIONAL PARKSROYALTY, NOBILITY & GENTRYARMED FORCES|CAMILLA, DUCHESS OF CORNWALLPRINCE PHILIP|WESTMINSTER, ENGLAND|SCOTLANDUNITED KINGDOM",

359,Who will pay tops the agenda as UN climate talks near end,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Calgary Sun,News,419,NEWS;Pg. A10,419,Alberta,,,,,Who will pay tops the agenda as UN climate talks near end,"GLASGOW - Approaching the final day of the two-week COP26 UN climate summit, delegations intensified efforts to strike a deal to tame global warming, with the focus on finding cash to help developing nations cope with its worst effects.A first draft of the COP26 accord released on Wednesday implicitly acknowledged current pledges were insufficient to avert climate catastrophe, and got a mixed response from climate activists and experts.However, a surprise agreement later in the day between China and the United States, the world's two biggest greenhouse gas emitters, boosted hopes that the almost 200 national delegations can toughen up their collective commitments by Friday.With a new draft expected in the coming hours, ""climate finance,"" or help for poor nations most vulnerable to the floods, droughts and rising seas triggered by global warming, is central to the negotiations.Britain's conference president, Alok Sharma, said the latest draft conclusions he had seen showed ""significant"" progress, but ""we are not there yet.""""I'd like to address the critical need to step up efforts today to get to where we need to be to realize substantive outcomes on finance,"" he said.Developing nations want tougher rules from 2025 onwards, after rich countries failed to meet a 12-year-old pledge to provide $100 billion a year by 2020 to help them curb emissions and tackle the effects of rising temperatures.Wednesday's draft merely ""urged"" developed countries to ""urgently scale up"" aid to help poorer ones adapt to climate change, and called for more funding through grants rather than loans, which add to debt burdens.The missed $100 billion goal is expected to be reached three years late, undermining the trust of developing nations and making some of them reluctant to make their emissions reduction targets more ambitious.The sum, which many campaigners say is woefully inadequate, is divided into a part for ""mitigation,"" to help poor countries with their ecological transition, and a part for ""adaptation,"" to help them manage extreme climate events.A more contentious aspect, known as ""loss and damage"" would compensate them for the ravages they have already suffered from global warming, though this is outside the $100 billion and some rich countries do not acknowledge the claim.Poor countries say a tax on carbon markets would provide critical support but rich nations, including European Union states, are concerned about the costs. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2021 Sun Media Corporation.

What has happened to their mustard seed-sized faith?True Christians believe that God is the creator of heaven and earth and in all things seen and unseen. Perhaps that only applies until real or imagined pitfalls are perceived.During the past week I have watched a small amount of the Cop26 TV coverage. Some people who had cycled hundreds of miles to Glasgow were somewhat shy when asked if they were going to be cycling back.It was noticeable that many other banners were being waved around that had nothing to do with so-called climate change. Perhaps others saw an opportunity for free advertising.In my view, the UK is in complete disharmony. 'Divide and Conquer' is rife. There are different movements battling for supremacy and have no hesitation in crushing those who challenge them.Well, fear not because we are all spiritual beings just stopping off on Earth for a brief period to have a human experience.One of my Jesuit friends (RIP) used to say that he was sure that just as we draw our last breath in this life the thought 'what was that all about' flashes across our minds.Kevin Roche",Copyright 2021 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|PLH|ENGLISH|National Edition|RELIGIONCHRISTIANS & CHRISTIANITYCATHOLICS & CATHOLICISM|TELEVISION PROGRAMMING|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|UNITED KINGDOM",

It's a big step and we don't underestimate the challenge of making that transition from what has been for far too long a private car-dominated city centre.'It is something that will have to be delivered in partnership with city centre businesses, which is why we will do it incrementally over the next five years or so.'It comes after the council rolled out its Spaces for People project during the pandemic, which aimed to prioritise pedestrians and cyclists over cars in large areas of Scotland's biggest city.'We need new ideas, a new vision and collaborations to create that better and sustainable life that we envision for everyone in Glasgow,' Ms Aitken added.WHAT'S YOUR OPINION?Text the word VIEWS followed by your comment, name and where you live to 65700.

Stepping in for First Minister Nicola Sturgeon - who was attending COP26 in Glasgow - during First Minister's Questions yesterday, Mr Swinney stressed the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the health service.Labour leader Anas Sarwar said: ""Mr Brown isn't the first avoidable death this winter, and if action isn't taken he will not be the last.""People are dying not because we don't have the treatments to help them, but because help isn't coming fast enough.""Extra funding announced in September across the health service ""was not enough"", Mr Sarwar said, adding: ""When will the government come forward with a sufficient package of support so we can prevent unnecessary suffering and deaths this winter?""Mr Swinney said the matter was unacceptable, adding: ""One of the reasons why the ambulance service is under so much pressure is because of the significant increase in demand in general for their services as a consequence of the pandemic.""But the Labour leader told Mr Swinney that cracks in the health service had been showing since before Covid-19 took hold.Visibly angered by the response from the deputy first minister, Mr Sarwar pointed to a survey from the Unite trade union released yesterday.""Given that answer, you can understand why 88% of the staff say they don't feel valued by the Scottish Government, you can understand why 98% of the staff say the announcements in September were insufficient.""We hear all the talk about record numbers of staff - the facts are this: 79% of the staff believe that they are understaffed and there are not enough of them.""

368,An accident waiting to happen at roundabout,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Evening Times (Glasgow),News,421,Pg. 29,421,Scotland,Heather Graham ,,,,An accident waiting to happen at roundabout,"PLEASE, could the powers that be and the relevant council department concerned address the serious road conditions at the Hillington Roundabout, as it is only a matter of time before a serious accident will happen there. The white paint road markings in several places at this roundabout are now totally non-existent and this is causing havoc.Motorists including myself who are familiar with this roundabout still have to have eyes in the back of our heads as cars are jumping in and out because motorists find themselves in the wrong road position for the exit they require. Motorists who are unfamiliar with this roundabout have no chance.I believe this roundabout must be one of the busiest in Glasgow. This roundabout is always very busy with traffic but especially at weekends when shoppers head for Braehead, this will escalate now with Christmas not too far away. Therefore, I would like to ask once again if the relevant council department could get its act together and attend to this urgent matter before anyone gets badly injured.With all the money that's been thrown at COP26, I don't think some white paint will burst their bank.E Kavanagh ONE hundred and three countries have pledged to significantly reduce methane from oil and gas wells, pipelines, decaying waste in landfill sites and livestock farming by 30% by 2030 compared with 2020 levels. The UK is on the threshold of having commercially available feed additives for cattle and sheep which has the potential to reduce their methane by more than 30%. Since there are 7.9 billion people in the world personally emitting methane gas and vegetarians and vegans even higher levels, can we please feed them the additives and the climate crisis would be solved within a year.Clark CrossIF the UK really wanted to reduce carbon emission granting the over 60s a free local travel pass might be one of the very best ways to do it. This simultaneously tackles old age poverty, reduces the need for older couples to have cars and tackles social isolation in later life. It might even stimulate our tourism industry or help reduce the damage of air travel, by encouraging people to take hotel breaks at home and avoid flying. It would be a well-earned reward and a gigantic morale booster, for people who have paid tax and national insurance over many decades of working life. But Boris Johnson, our gaffe prone goon of a gormless PM, normally prefers useless schemes which damage the environment and cost vast billions of pounds we cannot afford as a nation.

Home care services who look after the elderly and vulnerable people are among staff who are in line to get the first electric vehicles, a council meeting heard.?The social work home care service had to leave its base? in the Baillieston area due to lack of car parking for carers and managers.?The council's contracts and property committee meeting last week heard an ""extensive search"" was carried out to find new premises. But? there was no suitable building within the council's ownership.Referring to the council's 'green agenda' as COP26 takes place in the city,? Labour councillor Jim Kavanagh said: ""You say one of your principle reasons for moving is parking. So you get 22 spaces while we wish to utilise public transport and take people out of cars.""He added: ""There is absolutely nothing in this document that deals with electrical charging units in the pavilion. Having been at that pavilion a number of times - there is no electrical charging? facility whatsoever.""Councillor Kavanagh continued: ""The green agenda needs to be highly up this but it has disappeared off this paper.""A council officer replied: ""This office development was developed back in the late eighties early nineties. At that point there weren't electric vehicles - it was still a science project at that time.""He said the council has asked the landlord to look at putting in electric charging? points within? the 22 spaces, which is being investigated. But it is still unclear if that is possible - depending on the grid system capacity.

The animals will lose all their homes. ""It will be our fault.""The event was organised by Green New Deal Great Yarmouth, a group of local volunteers who campaign on climate change and promote green jobs and social equality.Maggie Brown, co-ordinator of Great Yarmouth group, said: ""I think the general public are very concerned about climate change and you can see that from the number of people here today.""We want to create a massive coalition in Yarmouth of people who are concerned about climate change.""I am hopeful for the future. I am a very optimistic person.""Ms Brown said Yarmouth could benefit from the creation of green jobs, such as at wind farms, and people can take individual action, such as ditching cars, to help save the planet.The group is in the process of organising a green jobs conference for early next year.The Clang for Climate event also saw stalls set up by groups concerned about the environment, such as the Green Party, Norfolk Beach Clean and Sea Shephard.It was held while world leaders are at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow.Anyone interested in joining Green New Deal Great Yarmouth can email the group at gndgreatyarmouth@gmail.comHave you got a story?

374,A reality check,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,High River Times,News,787,OPINION;Pg. A6,787,Alberta,John BarlowHigh River Times,,,,A reality check,"Canada's Prime Minister and his activist Cabinet need a strong dose of reality. Pandering to their personal global elite friends will have devastating ramifications on Canada's economy, families, and jobs.Trudeau's announcement at COP26 in Scotland to cap oil and gas emissions as well as his appointment of an eco-activist as Environment Minister leaves no doubt Canadian energy is under attack by our own government.Every Canadian must understand the critical role Alberta energy has on our lives, our economy and our standard of living.When it comes to development of natural resources, Canada imposes the most stringent regulatory, environmental and human rights standards in the world. According to data from the Government of Canada's 2019 National Inventory Report, Canada's oil sands per barrel greenhouse gas emissions have fallen 34 per cent since 1990, an incredible success story of innovation and commitment.Canadians rightfully have important questions for Trudeau regarding this announcement.Will the emissions cap also apply to the 750,000 barrels of oil imported into Eastern Canada from places like Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Venezuela? Countries with no environmental, human rights or labour standards whatsoever.Will this cap on emissions also apply to the cement industry in Quebec? According to Environment and Climate Change Canada the GHG intensity of the mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction sector in Canada used 62.7 tonnes of CO2e per TJ of energy used and dropping. In contrast, cement production uses 73.1 tonnes of CO2e per TJ of energy used. Will the cap apply to the auto industry in Ontario? Again, according to Environment and Climate Change Canada we account for 1.6% of global emissions and 11% of that is from the oil and gas sector compared to transportation which accounts for 26%.How will fossil fuels be replaced to heat homes, fuel vehicles and power our economy? Here is a reality check.According to Gridwatch, six per cent of Ontario's energy is coming from wind, solar and biofuels combined. What is the plan to replace the remaining 94% which comes from traditional fuels like nuclear and natural gas? The fact is, even if Canadian oilsands were entirely shut down, 80% of Canadian emissions would be burned by cars and trucks, using fuel processed from countries with lower environmental standards, multiple human rights abuses and harmfully increasing global emissions compared to Canadian oil and gas.This is not just an Alberta issue. Alberta oil and gas supports more than 1,000 Ontario businesses and more than 500,000 Canadian jobs. Canadian construction companies, manufacturing and technology firms, hospitals and schools all benefit from Alberta oil and gas. Canada's energy sector accounts for more than 10% of nominal Gross Domestic Product and government revenues from energy was nearly $18 billion in 2018.The contributions from energy development to our country cannot be overstated.When it comes to reducing emissions Canada is not the problem. In fact, it offers the solution.Here is how the Prime Minister can position Canada to take a leadership role in global environmental policy First, leverage Canada's worldclass innovations and resources like carbon capture a storage and LNG. Export our technology, our skilled labour and our resources to displace ""dirty"" energy being used in other parts of the world.Second, develop utility corridors across Canada to ensure our products like natural gas and hydro-electricity can be exported to other jurisdictions in Canada and around the world. This nation-building project would help unite Canada and reduce emissions. Canada should be energy self-sufficient and not hauling oil and gas by train or trucks.Third, put your money where your mouth is. Under the Liberal government, greenhouse gas emissions increased three percent despite implementing harmful bills like C-69 and C-48. Therefore, immediately stop importing oil from authoritarian regimes with no environmental or human rights standards.Fourth, stop ignoring the reality that significant harm is done to the environment by polluting our waterways. The government must get serious and ban municipalities like Montreal and Victoria from dumping raw sewage into the waterways.If the fight really is about climate change and emissions reductions, then these opponents of Canadian energy and pipelines would be speaking the truth. The truth is in Canada we do it better, safer and cleaner than anybody else in the world.Unfortunately, this is not about climate change or reducing emissions, because if it were the Liberals would be a proud champion of Canadian energy and implement these suggestions instead of stoking the alienation of Alberta.",Copyright 2021 High River Times All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|Opinion|prime,minister,activist,cabinet,strong,reality|BUSINESS NEWSEMISSIONSENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCESGREENHOUSE GASESHEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENTPRIME MINISTERSCLIMATE CHANGEECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORSENVIRONMENTAL LAWGOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERSENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTSIMPORT TRADEBIOENERGYBIOMASSECONOMIC NEWSENERGY & UTILITY SECTOR PERFORMANCEGROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCTLIVING STANDARDSMINING & ENVIRONMENTMINING & EXTRACTION SECTOR PERFORMANCENATURAL RESOURCESREPORTS, REVIEWS & SECTIONSHUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONSBIOPRODUCTSPETROLEUM EXPORTS & IMPORTSSTANDARDS & MEASUREMENTSAUTOMOTIVE SECTOR PERFORMANCEBIOFUELSEDITORIALS & OPINIONS|EMISSIONSOIL & GAS INDUSTRYENERGY & UTILITIESENERGY & UTILITY REGULATION & POLICYOIL SANDSBIOENERGYBIOMASSENERGY & UTILITY SECTOR PERFORMANCEMANUFACTURINGMINING & ENVIRONMENTMINING & EXTRACTIONMINING & EXTRACTION SECTOR PERFORMANCENATURAL GASNATURAL GAS EXTRACTIONNATURAL GAS PRODUCTSOIL & GAS REGULATION & POLICYELECTRIC POWER PLANTSWIND ENERGYBIOPRODUCTSPETROLEUM EXPORTS & IMPORTSCEMENT & CONCRETE PRODUCTIONCEMENT MFGAUTOMOTIVE MFGAUTOMOTIVE SECTOR PERFORMANCECONSTRUCTIONMOTOR VEHICLESBIOFUELS|ALBERTA, CANADAONTARIO, CANADAQUEBEC, CANADA|CANADANIGERIASAUDI ARABIASCOTLAND",
375,Are the EU and UK heading for a trade war?,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Gulf News (United Arab Emirates),News,836,,836,United Arab Emirates,"Mick O'Reilly, Foreign Correspondent",,SEA LTD,SEA LTD,Are the EU and UK heading for a trade war?,"If there is one thing that is predictable with the government of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson it is the lack of clarity on Brexit.It may be a matter of time before the Johnson government pulls the plug on the Brexit deal it negotiated with the European Union, saying that the Northern Ireland ""protocol"" isn't working.There are several sure signs this is about to happen.Firstly negotiators from the UK, led by Lord David Frost, have been meeting with their European counterparts to try and reach some sort of a resolution over the protocol. In case you've been in hibernation for the past 22 months — well, there has been a pandemic — the Northern Ireland protocol is the arrangement Johnson came to with the EU over how to deal with the thorny subject of Northern Ireland.For several years during those turgid Brexit negotiations so painfully worked on by former Prime Minister Theresa May, the sticking point was the land border between the British-governed province and the Republic of Ireland to the south. It was the only land border to be affected by the UK's decision to leave the EU after a marriage of 45 years. The big fear from all sides was that if Brexit was to result in the return of a ""hard"" border on the island of Ireland, there was every chance there would be a return to violence — the kind that resulted in some 3,600 deaths over 30 years of ""The Troubles"".Ultimately, May failed in her efforts to negotiate the Brexit deal — in large part because she had to rely on the support of 10 MPs from Northern Ireland who were stubbornly opposed to making any concession to Brussels that might weaken the link between their Unionist camp and England, Scotland and Wales across the Irish Sea.Exit May and enter Johnson, who was so eager to get Brexit done, he agreed to place the customs border down that Irish Sea, putting Northern Ireland effectively into the EU customs zone, splitting it off from the rest of the UK. And no, he proudly said time and time again, the Northern Ireland protocol, as the new arrangement would be called, would not create any more paperwork or mean any really change. Wrong, and wrong again — and he knew it then and knows it now.Northern Ireland is suffering because it is has been initially difficult to move goods across that Irish Sea customs line. Listen to any television or radio advertisement now for retailers in the UK and they will say in rushed voice or small print that delivery options do not apply to Northern Ireland. Who knows how Santa Claus will get around the red table come December 25!For its part and recognising some of the difficulties the protocol has caused, the EU has offered to relax inspections on some 80 per cent of goods moving across the 20 kilometres channel that separates Northern Ireland from the island of Great Britain.So with that kind of an offer on the table, why doesn't the Johnson government talked its way into reaching a settlement to allow everyone to move on?The answer is politics, plain and simple. And it is politics that will bring about the trade war, likely in the new year, methinks. Here's why.There is growing discontent in the UK over the rising cost of living and a shortage of goods on shelves and in the wider marketplace, The generic excuse that is used is that it's a global supply chain issue and a driver shortage. In my world, that translates into not having enough foreign labour to harvest crops, serve meals, drive trucks and keep the economy ticking along. And Brexit is part and parcel of the supply chain. If it's too much hassle to ship goods to the UK from the continent, those goods can be sold more easily — and trucked too — in the EU.Recent polls have started to suggest that most Britons — 70 per cent in one poll in October — think they are worse off since leaving the EU. Those trade deals and new world order haven't materialised. Or if they have, do little now. Welsh farmers say they livelihoods are now at risk because of a recent trade deal signed with New Zealand that will allow for the import of cheaper lamb. Whereas Brexit caused an immediate 5 per cent hit on the UK economy, a trade deal signed with Australia will only generate a 0.3 per rise in GDP over the next decade — hardly like for like.And right now, the Johnson government is mired in political sleaze scandals that resulted in it badly handling the resignation of one MP.Right now, COP26 is underway in Glasgow. That's why, for example, the UK and France quickly patched up their nasty little fishing dispute just before the summit opened.But as soon as the summit is over — and particularly if it not seen to be a success and if there's widespread criticism, then expect an announcement that the UK will be giving notice that intends to walk away from the Northern Ireland protocol.Already, the government in Dublin is making contingency plans for a trade way and has dusted off the blueprints it had in place in case a Brexit deal couldn't be reached.Yes a deal is there but Britannia may just not regard it.",Copyright 2021 Gulf News - Al Nisr Publishing LLC.

376,Asian shares advance after modest gains on Wall St,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),News,761,NEWS;Version:1,761,England & Wales,Via AP news wire,,WALT DISNEY CO,WALT DISNEY CO,Asian shares advance after modest gains on Wall St,"Shares were mostly higher in Asia on Friday after Wall Street  benchmarks managed to close mostly higher. Stocks advanced in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Seoul and Sydney in early trading. Shanghai  was flat. In China, a major Communist Party meeting ended Thursday with a resolution setting the stage for President Xi Jinping  to remain top leader for life. The decision was expected. Meanwhile, although the Chinese economy has been slowing after bouncing back from a pandemic downturn, the record $139.1 billion spent by Chinese shoppers during this year's annual Nov. 11 Singles' Day shopping extravaganza suggested potential for resilient retail demand. Shares in Chinese real estate developers have risen this week following news reports that regulators were considering easing curbs on borrowing that have fueled fears of possible defaults and depressed sales.Regulators want to allow more flexible financing so developers can sell assets and pay down debt, according to Chinese news reports. The government has yet to announce any change in the curbs imposed as part of efforts to reduce debt that Chinese leaders worry is dangerously high.Official data also show a rebound in mortgage lending in October, suggesting the Chinese central bank wants to ensure adequate financing for housing purchases, which is considered relatively safe, the business news magazine Caxin said, citing research by Citic Securities.Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 0.2% to 25,302.94 while the Shanghai Composite index was unchanged at 3,532.57. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 jumped 1.1% to 29,589.43, while the Kospi in South Korea added 1.4% to 2,966.09. In Sydney, the S&P/ASX 200 gained 0.9% to 7,447.80.The latest round of mostly solid corporate earnings is winding down after helping the broader market rise for weeks and reach a series of records. Inflation concerns have been rattling investors throughout the week, however. Recent data paint ""a picture of an economy running hot and with widespread price pressures,"" Craig Erlam of Oanda said in a report. ""The Fed  may ultimately prove to be correct in its judgement that pressures will ease naturally over time as they're broadly driven by temporary factors,"" he said. ""But how long can they afford to stand by and watch inflation dramatically overshoot their target? Are they really that confident in their assessment? The pressure is intensifying.""The benchmark S&P 500 is on track for its first weekly loss in six weeks. On Thursday, it rose 0.1% to 4,629.27. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4% to 35,921.23, largely due to a steep drop in entertainment company Walt Disney  which slumped 7.1% after reporting slower subscriber gains at its streaming channel and weak fiscal fourth-quarter financial results. The Nasdaq rose 0.5%, to 15,704.28.Smaller-company stocks outpaced the broader market in a sign that investors were confident about economic growth. The Russell 2000 rose 0.8%.Inflation concerns have pushed bond yields broadly higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury stood at 1.57% as of early Thursday in Asia, up from 1.55% late Wednesday. Bond markets were closed Thursday for Veterans Day. Companies have been warning that they are being squeezed by higher raw materials costs and supply chain problems. Consumers are already facing higher costs for essential items such as food, rent, autos and heating oil. Analysts worry they may cut spending on discretionary items to focus on essentials, which could then crimp the broader economic recovery. Higher inflation raises expectations that the Federal Reserve and other central banks will raise short-term interest rates deployed during the pandemic to encourage lending and spending. The Fed already has begun to pare back bond purchases it makes to keep longer-term rates low.In other trading, benchmark U.S. crude oil lost 60 cents to $80.99 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It gained 25 cents to $81.59 per barrel on Thursday. Brent crude, the basis for international pricing, gave up 64 cents to $82.23 per barrel. The dollar rose to 114.26 Japanese yen from 114.07 yen. The euro slipped to $1.1442 from $1.1451. ___AP Business Writer Joe McDonald in Beijing contributed.

The world has already experienced global warming of 1.1 C over the pre-industrial level. The IPCC warned that global warming will reach 1.5 C in the next two decades in the business-as-usual scenario, leading to disastrous consequences of climate change.Yadav, who is here to lead the Indian negotiators at COP26, said India has been well on track to meet whatever it promised as part of its nationally-determined contributions in 2015 and the country would definitely meet its climate neutrality goal backed by what the Prime Minister had announced last week.

379,AstraZeneca to sell Covid-19 vaccine for profit -after saving one million lives,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,standard.co.uk,News,652,"BUSINESS,PHARMACEUTICALS;Version:1",652,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Simon Freeman,,ASTRAZENECA PLC,ASTRAZENECA PLCPFIZER INCTALLGRASS ENERGY CORP,AstraZeneca to sell Covid-19 vaccine for profit -after saving one million lives,"Drug-maker AstraZeneca  has signed its first deals to sell the Covid -19 vaccine  developed with Oxford University for profit, having supplied more than 1.5 billion doses worldwide at cost price.The FTSE 100 giant committed to selling the shots ""at cost"" for the duration of the pandemic and expects the shift to generate ""modest profitability.""It has supplied 145 million doses to low-income countries through the World Health Organisation's Covax programme preventing an estimated five million Covid cases and saving more than one million lives.This will continue, with new contracts to wealthier countries sold under a tiered pricing structure. It expects profits to be ""much lower"" than those racked up by rivals Pfizer and Moderna.The transition to commercialising the jab in rich nations was announced today as the £140 billion Anglo-Swedish group issued a flurry of updates from a frenetic third quarter.Total revenue so far this year has grown by a third to $25.4 billion, with an acceleration in sales of 48% in the last three months to $9.9 billion.That is a landmark figure for the firm and puts CEO Pascal Soriot's goal of achieving $40 billion annual sales 2023 within reach.Revenues were up across its main areas of research with oncology up 19% to $9.4 billion, cardiovascular and renal sales rising 14% to $6 billion and immunology up 16% to $4.5 billion.                     It's been a huge contribution                   It also reported positive results for eight drugs in late-stage trials in its pipeline, including a treatment for life-threatening blood disorder Wilson's disease developed by recent $39 billion acquisition Alexion.The one-off costs of integrating the Boston-based rare diseases specialist into Astra's core operations dampened the mood among investors, however. Analysts highlighted a drop in year-to-date operating margins from 19.1% to 5.3%, while adjusted earnings per share -its preferred measure of profitability -of $1.08 fell short of the average analyst estimate of $1.24.It maintained its earnings guidance for the full year, expecting core earnings per share of between $5.05 and $5.40. Shares in the company, which have outpaced the sector and are up 23% this year, initially fell 5.2% before paring back losses to trade down 438p at 9006p.                     Je ne regrette rien                   Sales of Pfizer's shot are expected to bring in $36 billion this year. By contrast, Astra's Covid revenues were $1 billion in the quarter and its rollout has not been without headaches.Asked if he regretted initially agreeing to supply the vaccine at cost price Soriot said: ""I don't regret it at all. We are very proud of the impact we've had. ""This is the second largest vaccine in the world in terms of volume, has saved millions of hospitalisations and a million lives.

The crown jewel, its oncology franchise, goes from strength to strength.""Whilst AstraZeneca have historically sold their vaccine at cost, it appears the vaccine will transition to modest profitability serving as an additional earning tailwind in the coming quarters.""Nicholas Hyett, at Hargreaves Lansdown, noted the ""substantial"" fall in profit margins, saying: ""It's far too early to make judgements about the Alexion deal, but it does mean Astra has its work cut out.

380,Baffled by the Brexit protocol bust-up? Here are 7 of the key questions answered;The protocol dispute has become a shambles. John Downing clears up the main points,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Irish Independent,News,958,"NEWS;Pg. 10,11",958,Ireland,John Downing,,SEA LTD,SEA LTD,Baffled by the Brexit protocol bust-up? Here are 7 of the key questions answeredThe protocol dispute has become a shambles. John Downing clears up the main points,"BRITISH Brexit Minister David Frost is threatening to suspend Northern Ireland's special trade status, created to avoid a return of the northsouth border.It's a complex mess, but here we quickly explain all you need to know . 1. The UK keeps talking about 'invoking Article 16' - what the hell is that?Article 16 is effectively an 'emergency break' attached to the special terms given to Northern Ireland after Brexit. Either side can apply it if there are big problems economically, socially, environmentally, or when trade is disrupted.One month's formal notice is required before using this device - unless there is a dire emergency justifying immediate action.The sting is that the other party, which did not useArticle 16, is then entitled to apply retaliatory measures. That's when the fat goes in the fire.2. But didn't British Prime Minister Boris Johnson actually sign up to the EU-UK divorce terms, and then praise them as a good deal?Yes. Not only that, but David Frost actually did the negotiating himself for the latter phase of the dealmaking. The so-called Northern Ireland Protocol was part of the so-called WithdrawalAgreement done in October 2019.The Northern Ireland proviso was again explicitly endorsed in the so-called Trade and Co-operation Agreement done on Christmas Eve 2020.This framed new EU-UK free-trade terms and other forms of co-operation between neighbours.That is the part on which Mr Frost himself directly worked.But now, what could be termed 'buyer's remorse' has set in on the UK side.They say the deal is working out to be much worse in practice than they believed and they want it fundamentally changed.The London Conservative government is being goaded into this by the British Conservative radical Brexiteers and some Northern unionists - notably in the Democratic Unionist Party, which is in crisis over the issue.Checks on goods coming from England, Scotland and Wales into Northern Ireland mean a border in the Irish Sea.This has spooked the unionists, who fear it undermines their United Kingdom membership and also fuelled some street violence in the North.The protocol was designed to avoid a return of the Border and support the still fragile peace created by the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.Now unionists and London claim the current situation threatens peace.3. What is the EU response? Leading the EU side is Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic, who has said the deal cannot be reopened - but how it is implemented can be seriously modified.He has offered big changes ending 80pc of product checks and 50pc of customs checks while altering EU law to guarantee medicine supplies flow freely into the North.It was hard to sell those concessions to some EU states.The UK says these changes do not go far enough and that conditions have been there for some time for them to invoke Article 16 and set aside the North's special status.They have been refusing to do the product checks they signed up for and are all the time upping the stakes.Serious confrontations were avoided by extending ""grace periods"" for applying rules such as the ban on chilled meat imports. This avoided a threatened 'great British banger war' - but that still looms.4. What are the UK's specific arguments for invoking the set-aside clause that is Article 16? The disruption of Britain- Northern Ireland trade with a border in the Irish Sea.Total turmoil in the Democratic Unionist Party, which had three leaders in as many weeks earlier this year, and across the wider unionist community.The return of street disturbances in the North.An unduly legalistic application of the deal terms by the EU.5. Where is Ireland in all of this?Trying to limit the damage from being piggy in the middle.Dublin remains very much on the EU side because Brussels and the other member governments have been steadfast in supporting peace in the North, especially since the UK voters backed 'Leave' in June 2016.Quietly, they are trying to talk the UK down from the ledge, pointing to the huge harm for everyone - including themselves - that would come from a trade war.Ireland accepts that if the UK invokes Article 16, the EU will hit back hard.They are trying to keep retaliation as general as possible to avoid putting the North in the front line, raising the spectre again of border checks between what is legally the only land border between the EU and the UK. 6. When is any of this likely to happen?Most people believed the UK would not really stoke this one until its hosting of the climate change summit in Glasgow, COP26, ends today.Both negotiators, Mr Frost and Mr Sefcovic, will meet in London today for a stock-take of the negotiations.Something could happen as early as next week. But the phoney war - which is far better than a trade war - could drag on.If the UK does give a month's notice on invoking Article 16, then a period of intensive negotiations is required by the small print.If the EU goes for the nuclear option, and suspends the 2020 Trade and Co-operation Agreement, a year's notice is required.That time lag could help people see sense.7. But is this just a 'tough guy' negotiating stance by the UK to extract the last ounce?That would be positive if it were true.Granted, Mr Johnson twice took things to the brink before: in October 2019, by threatening a no-deal Brexit, and again in autumn 2020, by threatening to back out of the North's special trade status.There is a domestic political dividend for Johnson in squaring up to the Eurocrats.But taking things to the brink, especially very often, is an increasingly risky business.The EU partners are heartily fed up with Johnson and Co and are minded to take him on. Therein lies a whole welter of dangers.Dublin is trying to talk the UK down from the ledge",Copyright 2021 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|IIN|ENGLISH|SEA LTD|NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING & BROADCASTING & WEB SEARCH PORTALS|SE (NYSE)|National Edition|BREXITAGREEMENTSEUROPEAN UNIONNEGATIVE NEWSHEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENTUK DEMOCRATIC UNIONIST PARTYUK POLITICAL PARTIESGOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONBRITISH PRIME MINISTERSCHRISTMASPRIME MINISTERSEUROPEAN UNION LAWPOLITICAL PARTIESTREATIES & AGREEMENTSEXCISE & CUSTOMSNEGATIVE MISC NEWS|BORIS JOHNSON|LONDON, ENGLAND|ATLANTIC OCEAN|UNITED KINGDOMEUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATESNORTHERN IRELANDENGLANDEUROPEIRELANDSCOTLANDWALES",SE (NYSE)
381,Ban coming into force on many plastics,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Courier,News,297,NEWS;Pg. 17,297,England & Wales,ALASDAIR CLARK,,,,Ban coming into force on many plastics,"Scotland is set to ban a number of singleuse plastics from June next year under new laws to be introduced by the Scottish Government.Legislation has been introduced to parliament which would outlaw items such as plastic straws and cutlery.The Scottish Government said it is hoped the plans will ban some of the most ""environmentally damaging"" plastics.If confirmed the ban would come into effect from June 1 2022 in a bid to fight ""throwaway culture"".The list of single-use plastic items to be banned includes: Cutlery (forks, knives, spoons and chopsticks); Plates; Straws; Beverage stirrers; Balloon sticks. Food and drink containers and their lids, made of expanded polystyrene.Circular economy minister Lorna Slater said it was an example of the ""bold action"" needed to deliver on the commitments made at COP26.Ms Slater said: ""We are turning promise into action and banning some of the most problematic singleuse plastic items in Scotland.""Every year, hundreds of millions of pieces of singleuse plastic are wasted in this country.""They litter our coasts, pollute our oceans and contribute to the climate emergency. That has to end and this ban will be another step forward in the fight against plastic waste and throwaway culture.""Crucially, the legislation includes exemptions for single-use plastic straws, to make sure that those who need them for independent living or medical purposes can still get access to them.""But Ms Slater said her proposed ban would be at risk from the UK internal market.She added: ""The ban is at risk from the UK Internal Market Act, which effectively exempts any items that are produced in or imported via another part of the UK.""I will be writing to the UK government to ask that they take the necessary steps to ensure the integrity of this ban.""",Copyright 2021 DC Thomson Co Ltd All Rights Reserved,,Newspaper|TCR|ENGLISH|National Edition|LEGISLATIONLEGISLATIVE BODIESPLASTIC WASTENEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSPOLLUTION & ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTSCIRCULAR ECONOMYCOASTAL AREASECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS|SINGLE USE PLASTICSPLASTICSPLASTIC WASTEPLASTICS REGULATION & POLICYPOLYSTYRENEPOLYSTYRENE FOAM PRODUCTSCIRCULAR ECONOMY|SCOTLANDUNITED KINGDOM,
382,Belgian minister praises Glasgow\xE2s Housing First project to fight homelessness,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The National (Scotland),News,350,,350,England & Wales,Gregor Young,,,,Belgian minister praises Glasgow\xE2s Housing First project to fight homelessness,"A BELGIAN government minister has praised Glasgow\xE2s Housing First project for helping people break the cycle of homelessness.Meryame Kitir, who is in charge of development co-operation for major cities, is currently in Scotland for COP26 and took the opportunity to see how the Salvation Army helps provide intensive support to people in their own homes.The charity is commissioned by Glasgow Health and Social Care Partnership, in partnership with the Wheatley Group and Social Bite to help men and women overcome sustained and recurrent periods of rough sleeping and repeat homelessness.The minister met some of the service users who have been able to transform their lives through Housing First and said the Belgian government was looking closely at the success of the project.She said: \xE2It\xE2s inspiring to hear from the people who have turned their lives around thanks to Housing First. It\xE2s a credit to them that they have the courage to accept the support and try to change their lives.\xE2In Belgium we have a few pilot projects underway and are looking at Scotland and Finland as good examples of homelessness work. This project and what I have heard today is something I will take with me.\xE2Crucial to the success of Housing First is the support worker whose job, before helping someone move into a tenancy, is to identify their needs.For many people going through Housing First, their primary concern is financial \xE2 how they are going to pay bills and claim benefits, for starters.Salvation Army staff also make sure people are registered at their new address and their utilities are in place. Health and wellbeing is another priority and staff will help people register with a GP and go to any medical appointments with them.Kitir added: \xE2I\xE2ve been really impressed at how all the different partners in this project work together to provide the support a person needs. They provide more than just a roof over someone\xE2s head. Most of all they give a person respect. If someone doesn\xE2t feel respected or treated as an equal then the project would not succeed.\xE2",Copyright 2021 NewsQuest Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|HOMELESSNESSGOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONGOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERSRELIEF ORGANIZATIONSSOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE & LIFESTYLEMEDICINE & HEALTH|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|SCOTLANDBELGIUM",
383,Better government preferable to big or small government,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Sydney Morning Herald (Australia),News,599,OPINION;Leaders;Pg. 30,599,Australia,,,,,Better government preferable to big or small government,"The signs are everywhere that Prime Minister Scott Morrison has returned from the Glasgow COP26 summit and gone straight into campaigning for the federal election.In the past few days, Mr Morrison has engaged in the sort of meet-the-people exercises associated with the campaign trail, including a haircut and a session making gnocchi in front of television cameras.At the Victorian Chamber of Commerce in Melbourne, however, the Prime Minister made a more substantial speech, including what he said was a motto he intends to apply in future.He said he believed in solutions based on ""can-do capitalism"" rather than ""don't do government"".He attacked ""governments seeking to control people's lives and tell them what to do, with interventionist regulation and taxes that just force up your cost of living and force businesses to close"".He said this lay behind his decision to adopt a light touch approach to meeting Australia's 2050 net-zero target.The problem for Mr Morrison is that, as he admitted, the COVID-19 pandemic has given Australians an object lesson in the vital role that governments play in the modern economy.Thanks to the robust but mostly effective public health policies enforced by federal and state governments, Australia avoided tens of thousands of deaths.The US suffered 700,000 deaths, a per capita rate more than 30 times higher than Australia's, because of its laissez-faire approach.Mr Morrison acknowledged this showed that government intervention ""had its place"" but he said that it was ""time to break the habit"".In some respects he is clearly right that the balance between government and society must change. No one wants a return to lockdowns, curfews and zealous over-policing. Borders, both state and international, should be opened quickly now that more than 80 per cent of the population is vaccinated.Equally, the federal government had to draw a line under the tens of billions of dollars of JobKeeper and other stimulus that sustained the economy through the pandemic.Yet, Mr Morrison's view that, in general, government is bad and private enterprise is good is overly simplistic.Australians want their governments to look pragmatically at the problems we face - from an ageing population, to housing affordability to skills shortages - and work out what role government should play.Mr Morrison is being disingenuous in attacking all government activity since he himself is an enthusiastic supporter of intervention when it suits him - as evidenced by the pandemic stimulus and lockdown measures. His climate change policy also seems to be based on giving bureaucrats in the Clean Energy Finance Corporation billions of taxpayer dollars to fund research in clean technology.A true economic rationalist would set clear incentives such as a carbon tax which would give the private sector a greater role in determining the path of change.Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese has offered few of his policies yet and he must resist the ALP's tendency to go for tax-and-spend solutions.More government is not always the solution, especially when the federal budget will carry $729 billion in debt incurred during the pandemic.Rather than repeat ideological slogans of the last century, the challenge for both parties is to make governments run better.The Sydney Morning Herald is bound by the standards of practice of the Australian Press Council.

384,BHP keeps faith with growth,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Australian,News,911,BUSINESS;Pg. 16,911,Australia,Nick Evans,,BHP GROUP PLC,BHP GROUP PLCRIO TINTO GROUP,BHP keeps faith with growth,"BHP chief executive Mike Henry says he is not concerned that the energy crisis in Europe and China will crimp global economic growth in the near term, saying the big miner still sees a strong outlook for the global economy in that timeframe.Speaking after the company's annual shareholder meeting on Thursday, Mr Henry said the ""perturbations"" in energy markets were affecting inflationary pressures in the short term, but he did not believe there would be a longer-term implication for economic growth across the world.""Of course with high energy prices we're seeing some inflation,"" Mr Henry said. ""But that hasn't changed our very positive outlook for global economic growth. Our medium-term outlook for the recovery from Covid-19 is still for strong economic growth."" And, while Mr Henry would not be drawn on the short-term outlook for iron ore prices, he said he was not concerned by the sharp tumble in the price of the steelmaking commodity in recent months.Iron ore futures traded on the Singapore exchange recovered slightly on Thursday, trading at $US92.20 a tonne on Thursday night, after hitting a low of $US87.87 on Wednesday.Spot iron ore prices were trading at about $US92 a tonne on Tuesday, according to FastMarkets data.Iron ore is now trading more than 60 per cent below record highs of about $US237 a tonne in May, as China curtails steel mills and concerns grow around the country's construction industry.But Mr Henry said that even after the sharp falls, iron ore was still trading at high levels compared to historical averages, and it was clear Chinese demand was still strong.""The Chinese steel industry will produce a billion tonnes of steel for the second year running, and our outlook for the Chinese economy does remain very positive,"" he said.Almost 13 per cent of BHP shareholders voted against the company's carbon reduction action plan, after the resources major put its climate transition plan to an Australia-first shareholder vote.The result, based on proxy votes of BHP shareholders cast ahead of the meeting, came after chairman Ken MacKenzie faced a raft of questions from shareholders at the company's AGM over its approach to reducing emissions, and in particular its support for the development of the Scarborough gas project in Western Australia.BHP's goal of reducing its own carbon footprint by 30 per cent by 2030 has now been eclipsed by those of its major rivals, with Rio Tinto targeting a 50 per cent reduction by the same date.Glencore, the world's biggest coal producer, has set a 2035 target for halving its carbon emissions, and Fortescue Metals has set the most ambitious target of all, saying its operations will have net zero emissions by 2030.Mr MacKenzie defended BHP's targets, saying the mining giant had set reduction targets that were appropriate for its own commodity mix.""It's great to see others joining with us in that ambition. But the portfolios are different,"" he said.""In the case of Rio, just to give some perspective, the scale of the challenge for Rio is that even after it achieves its operational emissions targets - and we all hope they do - their emissions in 2030 will be about the same as BHP today, and about 50 per cent above where BHP expects to be 2030,"" Mr MacKenzie added.But environment groups said BHP needed to do more to improve its emissions targets.Dan Gocher, director of climate & environment at the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, said the vote represented a strong message to the BHP board.""Given BHP would have been expecting shareholder support to exceed 95 per cent, this level of opposition demonstrates that a significant number of shareholders expect BHP to go further,"" Mr Gocher said.""This is the lowest 'say on climate' vote globally since the mechanism was introduced earlier this year.""Even still, it is disappointing to see investors fail to match their words at COP26 with action. This vote suggests institutional investors are easily cowed by big companies like BHP and they're unwilling to force them to adhere to the Paris Agreement."" Mr Henry stamped his mark on the future of BHP when delivering the company's annual results. In addition to handing record dividends back to shareholders, he ended weeks of speculation by announcing a deal to merge its petroleum division with ASX-listed Woodside Petroleum.In a flurry of announcements to coincide with BHP's annual results release, Mr Henry launched a radical reshaping of the company's structure and commodity focus - with BHP to exit petroleum, enter the potash market and unify its dual-listed corporate structure.BHP paid a record dividend of $US2 a share on the back of an $US11.3bn ($15.5bn) net profit for the full year, taking its total return to shareholders to $US15bn for the full year.Mr Henry also announced the approval of the $US5.7bn construction of the first stage of its Jansen potash project in Canada.BHP is still to release the full details of the petroleum division merger plans with Woodside, but Mr MacKenzie told shareholders the surprise downgrades in the reserves of Woodside would have no impact on negotiations over the terms of the deal.""We've done our own due diligence on the Woodside business, the downgrade doesn't change our assessment of, or appetite for, the merger,"" he said.""And the reserves are only one of many factors that go to the valuation and merger ratio. So we're comfortable.""

385,BinMEN dispute continues over 'side waste',"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Evening Times (Glasgow),News,368,Pg. 7,368,Scotland,Catriona Stewart ,,,,BinMEN dispute continues over 'side waste',"COUNCIL bosses and binmen remain at loggerheads over refuse collection days after workers returned from strike action.GMB Scotland members walked out on the first day of COP26, ­October 31, in a dispute over pay and conditions.Now they have returned to duty, significant amount of 'side waste' - overflowing rubbish - is waiting to be collected.But the Glasgow Times understands union members are asking for an additional payment to collect the waste.Glasgow City Council, however, is not willing to pay it.A GMB spokesperson said: ""Discussions with the council remain ongoing about the safe handling of what's defined as putrid side  waste - but let's be clear this is a problem that also existed before the strike. ""The GMB says cleansing staff are key workers and their contribution to the city is underpaid and undervalued.The spokesperson added: ""It comes back to the issue of how we properly value key workers that are being asked to undertake additional hazardous tasks and, in this case, tasks that other council's cleansing workers ordinarily would not undertake. ""Again, the council should engage constructively with our reps on such matters.""  Waste quickly accumulated around the city during the walk out.Collections have resumed but streets are still filthy with litter and rubbish bags sitting out on pavements.On Monday when workers returned to shift, there were issues at Western Depot where staff claim they were ""goaded"" by a supervisor and told to go home.The issue was later resolved but the overarching problem of cleaning up ""putrid"" side waste remains.A Glasgow City Council spokesperson said binmen were not being asked to do anything not already in the terms of their employment.She said: ""The role of our cleansing staff is to pick up litter and waste so we are not asking them to do anything outwith their contract of employment. ""We have written to GMB Scotland this morning on this specific subject to clarify that all health and safety assessment have been jointly reviewed and agreed and therefore to instruct their members and our employees, that they should pick up waste regardless if it is in a wheelie bin or side waste and accumulated over the days of industrial action.""",Copyright 2021 Newsquest Media Group All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ETI|ENGLISH|agriculturebusinesscrime|LABOR UNIONSSTRIKESCITY GOVERNMENTESSENTIAL BUSINESSES & WORKERSLEGISLATIVE BODIESREGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTSSOLID WASTE COLLECTIONEMPLOYMENT CONTRACTSMANAGERS & SUPERVISORSCITIESLITTERINGSAFETY, ACCIDENTS & DISASTERS|SOLID WASTE COLLECTIONMEDIA & TELECOMMUNICATIONS|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|SCOTLAND",

That's a statement that's even harder to take at face-value than usual when it's being made by Boris Johnson - the establishment's answer to Del Boy Trotter.In a typical exhibition combining his main attributes of brass neck, incompetence and entitlement, Boris took to our screens again this week to try and downplay the significance of the scandal his own pig-headedness created.A scandal which started as a cut-and-dry case of a Tory breaking lobbying rules that has since developed into a full-blown political crisis.The COP26 conference now risks being overshadowed by his antics - a true measure of the buffoonery he perfectly embodies.

387,Boris - it's time to dump Rumpole of the Caymans;littlejohn,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Scottish Daily Mail,News,1054,NEWS;Pg. 23,1054,"Scotland
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland",Richard Littlejohn,,TALLGRASS ENERGY CORP,TALLGRASS ENERGY CORP,Boris - it's time to dump Rumpole of the Caymanslittlejohn,"EVENTS, dear boy, etc. There comes a moment in every Prime Minister's tenure when the real world rises up and bites them on the backside. Life doesn't always read the script. The best-laid plans and so on, and so on, and scooby dooby dooby.Tony Blair's state visit to Japan in 2003 was turned upside down when he got off the plane in Tokyo to learn that Dr David Kelly, Britain's Iraq Weapons of Mass Destruction inspector, had been found dead with his wrists slashed in an Oxfordshire forest.At his subsequent set-piece press conference with the Japanese PM, the Boys In The Bubble weren't the slightest bit interested in discussing Anglo-Nippon relations. All they wanted to know was whether Blair had blood on his hands.During the 2010 election campaign, Gordon Brown turned up on Jeremy Vine's excellent Radio 2 lunchtime show to talk about how he'd saved the world from financial meltdown, only to be ambushed with a recording of his 'bigoted woman' remarks directed at Rochdale pensioner Gillian Duffy, who had confronted him over immigration.In similar vein, Boris Johnson returned to Glasgow this week with every intention of delivering a triumphant bulletin on the progress made at Cop26 in the battle against global warming.The hacks on the spot had other ideas. Tell us about Geoffrey Cox, the formerTory Attorney General who has trousered more than five million quid working as a lawyer while he was supposed to be an MP.What was Cox doing in the British Virgin Islands during the Covid lockdown?Er, sorry chaps, I've got a train to catch, said Boris. Everybody back in the buffet car.AT LEAST this time Boris took the rattler, rather than chartering a private plane. But scuttling away from scrutiny was not a good look. Nor did it do him any favours lingering furtively on the concourse at King's Cross station earlier in the week to avoid having to face the Commons over the Owen Paterson scandal.Sticking up for your mates is commendable. Defending the indefensible is not.Paterson was bang to rights and should have been made to walk the plank sooner. As for Cox, where do we start? Since 2009, he's spent an astonishing 10,700 hours moonlighting from the House.During Covid, he was to be found living the Death In Paradise dream, working on a Caribbean government corruption inquiry. It's one thing topping up your Parliamentary salary with the odd speech or newspaper column, provided it doesn't interfere with the day job. It's quite another filling your boots with lucrative refreshers in a Cayman Islands courtroom.Hilariously, Cox is reported to have grumbled that the 18 months or so he spent as Attorney General under Mother Theresa actually cost him money, despite pocketing a salary of around £150,000 a year.That might be chicken-feed in the legal world, but it's a king's ransom to most voters in the Red/Blue Wall who put the Tories into office with a thumping 80-seat majority.So, too, is the £500,000 Owen Paterson banked working as a consultant on top of his MP's wages.Look, if Cox wants to play at being Rumpole of the Caymans, good luck to him. But he can't do it while drawing a parliamentary salary at the same time.And this is where it gets really grubby. It transpires that Cox is also renting out his London home while claiming £1,900 a month from taxpayers for a second property. He even claimed £3,800 while he was in the West Indies.For an allegedly bright barrister, how stupid is he? He's been around Westminster long enough to know that perception is all.Claiming for one property, while renting out another takes us straight back to the expenses scandal of 2009. We're talking Jackboots Jacqui Smith here, the former Labour home secretary and MP for Redditch who tried to pretend that her sister's spare bedroom in South London was her 'main residence'.Some 'honourable members' went to prison after their various scams were exposed. That should have been a warning to them all.How long before we discover that Cox has been claiming for a duck house and moat cleaning?Boris is, of course, no stranger himself to creative accounting - what we used to call in Fleet Street 'Old Spanish Customs'. No matter how much he earns, he always seems to be a shilling short of balancing the books. The cost of refurbishing the Carrie Cave in Downing Street, revealed by our own Simon Walters, is still under investigation.Owen Paterson's persecutor, standards gauleiter Kathryn Stone, is currently sticking her nose into Boris's holiday at Zac Goldsmith's drum in Marbella.Frankly, most of us couldn't give a monkey's if Boris stays with an old friend. It's not like Tony and Cherie Blair turning up on Cliff Richard's doorstep or freeloading off Silvio Berlusconi or one of the Bee Gees.What does cut through, however, is the stench of what we have learned to call 'Tory sleaze', the idea that the rules don't apply to them.Cox has legitimate questions to answer. Not least: Is he really only 61? In which case there's hope for us all. But Boris should pull the rug from under him, right now.Some of us have supported BoJo since he ran for London mayor and saved us from the Red Ken terror. He battered Corbyn and Got Brexit Done, after a fashion.So he enjoys a residue of goodwill, even in those Northern seats where the natives are getting restless.HE HAS an uncanny ability to paint himself into a corner and walk out over the paint. But there is a growing feeling that he may be reaching the tipping point where even his most trenchant backers decide he has delighted us too long.It's instructive that his fiercest critics lately have been proper Conservatives, whose patience he has exhausted.There's mutiny in the ranks, too, as evidenced yesterday when his Chancellor, the ultra-ambitious Rishi Sunak, put the boot in on the wireless.Prime ministers always find themselves in trouble when the lower orders are no longer frightened to rebel. It's blood- letting time, Bojo. Starting with Cox and maybe even Sunak, pour encourager les autres.Stop the greenwash posturing, the pseudo-socialist, tax-hiking, big statism and remember why you went into politics in the first place, as a free-booting libertarian.At the moment, Boris is dancing in the dark. It's time he took charge of, rather than cowering in the face of, events, dear boy, events. Right now, it's his backside on the line.",Copyright 2021 Associated Newpapers Ltd.

388,Boris Johnson faces legal challenge over backing for Priti Patel on bullying claims,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),News,553,"NEWS,UK,UK POLITICS;Version:1",553,England & Wales,Adam Forrest,,,,Boris Johnson faces legal challenge over backing for Priti Patel on bullying claims,"Downing Street faces a looming court challenge over Boris Johnson 's decision to stand by Priti Patel  on bullying allegations, in a case set to reignite questions about the government's stance on standards.The prime minister was criticised for disregarding the findings of an investigation into the home secretary's behaviour carried out by his independent ethics adviser last year.Sir Alex Allan's report said that Ms Patel's behaviour - said to include some instances of shouting and swearing - had ""been in breach of the ministerial code, even if unintentionally"".But Mr Johnson decided the home secretary had not broken the ministerial code, said the government considered the matter ""closed"" and told Conservative MPs to ""form a square around the Pritster"".The FDA union, which represents civil servants, has successfully brought a judicial review of Mr Johnson's decision - a case which will be heard at the Royal Courts of Justice on Wednesday and Thursday next week.Speaking ahead of the court hearing, Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA, said: ""The prime minister, as the final arbiter of the ministerial code and minister for the civil service, has a duty to ensure that civil servants can work with ministers without fear of being bullied or harassed.""The union leader claimed Mr Johnson's decision ""potentially allows ministers to avoid the consequences of their behaviour in future by pleading that it should be the intent of their actions which is important, not the consequences.""The result is that civil servants' confidence in challenging unacceptable behaviour from ministers has been fatally damaged ... That is why we are asking the court to rule that the prime minister misdirected himself.""Mr Penman insisted the legal challenge was not an attempt to make the home secretary face sanctions, but about decisions made by the prime minister. ""This is simply about how the ministerial code is interpreted.""It comes as Mr Johnson's government faces growing pressure over various ""sleaze"" claims after last week's failed attempt to rewrite disciplinary rules and and save ex-Tory MP Owen Paterson  from suspension.Lord Evans, chair of the government's independent standards committee has urged the government to restrict MPs from holding some second jobs. He said his committee had made recommendations as far as 2018 that MPs should be banned from holding consultancy and advisory jobs.""We recommended that MPs should not accept any paid work to provide services such as parliamentary strategists, or advisors, or consultants - because that was in tension with the main job,"" he said on Thursday.Mr Johnson insisted that Britain is not ""remotely a corrupt country"" amid continuing fallout over sleaze concerns. But Labour claimed the PM's failure to apologise for his role in undermining public trust in politics proved that ""he doesn't care about tackling corruption"".

389,Boris Johnson is making SNP complacent about path to Scottish independence – Joyce McMillan,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Scotsman,News,972,COLUMNISTSPOLITICSNATIONALSCOTLANDBORIS JOHNSON,972,Scotland,Joyce McMillannewsdeskts@scotsman.com,,,,Boris Johnson is making SNP complacent about path to Scottish independence – Joyce McMillan,"Every chapter of the Johnson premiership so far – from the pell-mell rush in 2019 to get the worst possible kind of Brexit done, to the current scandal over lavish external payments to MPs – has fitted perfectly with the SNP narrative that the UK is a corrupt old state which has had its day, cannot bring itself to co-operate with other nations as equals, and is hopelessly bound to the interests of a global financial elite which is irreversibly trashing the planet; and it must be hard for the First Minister and her colleagues not to feel that given the scale of the mess at Westminster, the gradual shift of Scottish opinion towards the idea of independence is only a matter of time.The truth is, though, that while the current state of the Westminster government helps keep the SNP in power in Scotland, it often also militates against the party’s best interests, by setting up such a low bar for good governance that Nicola Sturgeon’s government can out-perform it almost by default.That the First Minister has out-manoeuvred Boris Johnson at the current COP26 conference is obvious, for example; she has not only worked the room brilliantly in terms of asserting Scotland’s presence on the international stage, but has also held a series of substantial meetings reflecting her long-term interest in the subject, not least with global women’s organisations, and with the Under2 coalition of cities and regional governments committed to rapid carbon reduction.Johnson, by contrast, has been blustering his way up and down the country in an effort to avoid parliamentary sleaze debates, and is clearly both preoccupied and discredited to an extent that may seriously damage the UK’s authority in steering the event to any successful outcome.READ MORE: Boris Johnson's blunders over Owen Paterson affair risk putting wind in SNP's sails – John McLellanYet in relation to climate policy as in some other areas, the First Minister’s vastly more effective performance on the international stage conceals some serious failures – to meet Scotland’s own carbon emissions targets, to strengthen Scotland as a manufacturing centre for renewable energy systems, and above all to confront the huge gas and oil interests that are still trying to stall and divert the climate debate, after decades of near-criminal disinformation and denial.The truth is that in this field as in many others, there is currently no pressure on the Scottish government to raise its game – by, for example, declaring its straightforward opposition to any further opening up of new oil and gas fields – because it can always present itself as the lesser of two evils; and that is a dangerous situation for the SNP in at least two ways.In the first place, it is quite clear from the current polling figures in Scotland – which show support for independence still just below 50 per cent – that even under a fiercely unpopular UK government, the historic ties that bind the Union remain strong.It will take more than a display of slightly superior competence, or slightly greater concern for social justice and cohesion, to encourage the as yet undecided to reimagine those bonds in a different form, and to embrace the idea of independence.It will take, at the minimum, a plan, a vision, a stronger set of distinctive policies, a series of robust answers to troubling questions, and also a road map that explains how the transition will be negotiated, in order to avoid the major disruptions associated with the botched negotiation of Brexit.And above all, it will take that kind of plan to make the independence movement resilient to sudden changes in the English, and therefore the UK, political landscape.The idea of perpetual Tory government from London has become a common trope among independence supporters; but if the Tory meltdown continues and a UK election comes early, if English voters make one of their sudden volte-faces and decide that even Keir Starmer has to be better than Johnson and his crew – well, it may be that Scotland’s vision of an independent future is now so well advanced that the SNP can take the referendum Starmer might offer, and win it; or it may be that ever-pragmatic Scottish voters decide they will give the British state one more last chance to reform and redeem itself.Long-term supporters of independence hate to consider this possibility, of course; for them, the journey to “yes” is a one-way ticket, supported by a strong ideological belief in national sovereignty as a good in itself.Most human beings, though, are of a different mind. Faced with competing political structures, they tend to view them pragmatically, for what protections they afford, and what kind of future they offer; and if the UK greatly improves its offer, they will undoubtedly feel free to retreat from the idea of independence, and give the Union another go.There is, in other words, no room at all for complacency on the part of the SNP leadership; no time for popcorn, and very little for schadenfreude, however enjoyable.The case for Scottish independence is strong, and greatly supported by the striking success of many nations of similar size, all around us in northern Europe.Yet it needs constant burnishing, sharpening, and adaptation to changing times; and above all, it needs a Scottish government with the courage to offer a truly sustainable and inspiring future, if Scotland is to be ready at the moment when the tectonic plates of politics shift again, and a clear pathway to independence lies open, once more.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this article.

We want to make sure that this is part of mainstream culture.\xE2Clare Searle, Chief Strategy Officer at G&C, said: \xE2Many people only feel able to take action when it seems simple, they can easily access and understand the information, or there are people around to support them.\xE2We want to help those people who feel they cannot make an impact or don\xE2t know where to start.\xE2Our aim is to create a community discussion around making the best choices for ourselves and our planet.\xE2The group's sustainability hub has been supported by The Glades\xE2 owners LaSalle Investment alongside the local council, and if successful, will serve as a pilot and blueprint for sustainability hubs in other shopping centres across the country.Behavioural science data will be collected from the Bromley pilot hub, focusing on the most effective community engagement methods that have created tangible changes in homes and beyond.Data will be used to draft blueprints for future Hubs, and will also help councils with community engagement.Funding of \xC2270,000 and donations towards the project have already been secured, and G&C has raised more than \xC230,000 with local fundraising over the past three months.It is hoped that the Bromley Hub pilot will open in the New Year.If you\xE2d like to donate to G&C\xE2s fundraising campaign, click here.",Copyright 2021 NewsQuest Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|SUSTAINABILITYASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONSCOMMUNITY ACTIVISMSHARING ECONOMYSOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE & LIFESTYLESUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTCOMPANY STRATEGYFAMILYGREEN ECONOMYGREEN FINANCELABOR MARKETCLIMATE CHANGEENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCESPOLLUTION & ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTSMATERIALS RECOVERY & RECYCLINGSOLID WASTE TREATMENT & DISPOSALVOLUNTEERSBIODIVERSITYMEDICINE & HEALTHEXECUTIVES|SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTGREEN ECONOMYGREEN FINANCERETAILERSSHOPPING CENTERS & MALLSMATERIALS RECOVERY & RECYCLINGMEDIA & TELECOMMUNICATIONSSOLID WASTE TREATMENT & DISPOSALWASTE MANAGEMENT & REMEDIATION SERVICES|LONDON, ENGLAND|UNITED KINGDOM",

393,"By focusing on sleaze and not trees, what on earth was Boris Johnson doing?;That's the question every journalist was asking this week as the PM took his eye off the ball, writes Andrew Woodcock","November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),News,511,VOICES;Pg. 32,511,England & Wales,ANDREW WOODCOCK,,,,"By focusing on sleaze and not trees, what on earth was Boris Johnson doing?That's the question every journalist was asking this week as the PM took his eye off the ball, writes Andrew Woodcock","Along with the arcane details of the rules on MPs' second jobs, the mind-boggling puzzle which has been bending the brains of journalists and MPs in Westminster this week boils down to a simple question: what on earth did Boris Johnson think he was doing?This was the week, after all, which he had lined up as his moment to be hailed as the saviour of the world by securing a big deal on climate change at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow.Instead, TV viewers from around the globe were presented with the unedifying spectacle of a British prime minister - in a press conference abruptly truncated after just 22 minutes - being repeatedly asked to apologise for trying to undermine his own country's democratic procedures and being forced to declare to the millions watching that the UK is not a corrupt country.Since he became PM, Mr Johnson has never ceased reminding people of the opportunity provided by the hosting of the United Nations conference - following the G7 in Cornwall in June - to put the UK at the heart of global diplomacy and send the ""global Britain"" message around the world.Given these high hopes, ""We're not corrupt"" can hardly have been the message he wanted to send.For a politician who loves the chance to shine on a big stage, Mr Johnson seems to have been remarkably insouciant about preparing the ground for his big moment.Rather than clearing his diary of anything not climate-related and turning a laser focus on the minutiae of the agreement being ground out in Glasgow, he appeared more preoccupied with preserving MPs' perks in Westminster.His botched attempt to save Owen Paterson from the inconvenience of a 30-day suspension from the Commons ensured that during the crucial week of climate negotiations, headlines were dominated by sleaze not trees.Tory MPs insist that they gave whips plenty of warning that they weren't happy being ordered to back a scheme which seemed so blatantly to be manipulating Westminster's standards procedures for the benefit of one of their colleagues.And they are now throwing their hands up in horror at the casual way their leader has revived the spectre of sleaze which inflicted so much harm on the Tories in the 1990s.Explanations being bandied around privately by Tory MPs are not complimentary towards Johnson. Some say he lost interest in Cop as soon as the razzmatazz left town along with fellow leaders like Joe Biden last week, others that he was too lazy and undisciplined to engage with the details of the negotiation or too complacent in the security of his 80-seat majority to consider the damage he might inflict while trying to help out an old comrade of the Brexit battle.Others think he is nursing a grudge against the standards commissioner for finding against him in the past and was all too eager to jump on an opportunity to stop her doing it again.Whatever the truth of the matter, there can be little doubt that the image of prime ministerial disengagement and disarray is not the message Mr Johnson hoped to send the rest of the world this week.Yours,Andrew WoodcockPolitical editor",Copyright 2021 Independent Print Ltd All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|IA|ENGLISH|Voices|PRIME MINISTERSWRITERSNEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWSUK CONSERVATIVE PARTYAGREEMENTSBRITISH PARLIAMENTDIARY KEEPING & JOURNALINGPOLITICAL CORRUPTIONPRESS CONFERENCESBRITISH PRIME MINISTERSINTERNATIONAL RELATIONSCONFERENCES & CONVENTIONSHEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENTPOLITICAL PARTIESUS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016UNITED NATIONSBREXITUNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS|WRITERS|BORIS JOHNSONJOE BIDEN|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|UNITED KINGDOM",

They have peaked in Glasgow: As negotiations close this week, a major point of contention between rich and poor countries is whether the final summit document will acknowledge the need for a separate pool of money to address historic harms.Every country has to agree on every word in the text.Known by sterile code words crafted to avoid blame, ""loss and damage,"" that fund would be separate from money to help poor countries adapt to a changing climate, its proponents have argued.

She said Scotland would devote about $2.8 million to address what it called ""structural inequalities.""""Finance is key to this not as an act of charity but as an act of reparation,"" she said Thursday at the summit. She called on rich countries to ""start to pay their debt to the developing countries around the world."" Huq called Sturgeon's announcement a vital nudge. Scotland, after all, describes itself as the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution, a center of shipbuilding and heavy industry, which profited from British colonialism and the African slave trade before that.Scotland's pledge is ""not for charity, not for helping poor people, but taking responsibility and paying a debt to the people who are going to be affected,"" Huq said. The latest draft statement from the summit, released Wednesday, says little about loss and damage except to cite the ""urgency of scaling up action and support, including finance"" for loss and damage. It says nothing specific about setting up a separate funding stream nor how much. This led a bloc of island nations to say that emerging economies would not put forth more ambitious emissions reductions targets, ""if we don't scale up the provision of finance, and this includes the long overdue recognition of a separate and additional component for loss and damage.""A fight on the issue is expected in the closing hours of the summit.Estimates of the amount of money required to address loss and damage varies widely, from roughly $300 billion to $600 billion a year by 2030.

While Hewitt argues ""no one seriously believes electric or hydrogen-powered aircraft will be flying long-haul routes"", hybrid manufacturer Aura Aero might prove her wrong.Created in 2018 by former Airbus staff, the company made a name for itself when it said it wanted to become the Tesla of aviation. ""I'm taking Tesla as a reference point because it didn't relegate itself to some fuzzy concept, but the company worked to make its idea happen,"" explained the company's chief executive Jeremy Caussade to City A.M. at its Toulouse hangar.Just like the Palo Alto company, AuraAero is in a unique position within the aviation market. The company's planned fleet aims to wow enthusiasts as well as reduce the flight shame of business and leisure travel.The Integral family is a two-seater plane for training, leisure or even aerobatics purposes.More encouraging for green aviation enthusiasts, Aura Aero is developing the Electric Regional Aircraft (ERA), a 19-seater battery-powered plane that could travel up to 200 nautical miles, enough to fly from London to Paris.While ERA is expected to enter service in 2027 on short to medium routes, for the midterm future the company is also working on propeller aircraft.""If we are not looking to have intermediate solutions, we can't go fast into the zero emission aircraft [market],"" Caussade said. ""For use it's a matter of assessing which aircraft we can put into the market as soon as possible that can signify the biggest step towards zero emissions.""In the last few years, the net-zero transition has become a focus for France. In April, President Macron implemented a ban on short-haul flights if they could be replaced by a 2h30 train ride, echoing similar laws passed in Austria.The measure received mixed reviews by carriers.Caussade said the short-haul flight ban has only acted as a warning for the aviation sector to engage more with politicians. ""Maybe we didn't discuss enough with politicians and explained what the roadmap to decarbonisation could be,"" he said.Instead of an aviation ban, Causses has called on all stakeholders to work on multimodality.",Copyright 2021 City A.M.

So you need to have places to charge electric cars quickly. At the moment, we have these guzzling stations everywhere but more and more you will need to have accessible charging possibilities for cars,"" she told i.""The infrastructure for charging is very important and that is something you need to think about and plan in good time.""Street chargepoints are particularly valuable for the third of UK households who don't have a garage or driveway to install a charger of their own.Denmark, Finland and other Nordic countries are among the greenest societies in the world and Ms Lehtomäki suggests the UK and other countries could learn valuable lessons from them.An eco-label found on packaging for goods and services across the region gives information about plastic and chemical footprints, and its governments are now working to expand the information to include carbon footprint as well.They already provide information on the carbon footprint of food, alongside details of its nutritional content, on various websites.Good communication is essential for helping the public to become more climate friendly, Ms Lehtomäki says.""Making it clear to consumers what they need to do and what kind of concrete actions it requires is crucial. We try to make it easier for ordinary citizens to make green and sustainable choices - so we tell the public that this action or produce is not only environmentally sustainable but also sustainable in a climate sense.""It needs to be very easy so it will be done. It's good both to know that doing something is a good choice and that it's doable. With recycling, for example, it's not a matter of money, it's a matter of access to recycling centres and knowing what it is that is important to recycle.""As a parting tip, Ms Lehtomäki says nations have much to teach - and learn from - each other where the environment is concerned.""It's very important for us to learn from the successes of others and also we have success stories to tell.""",Copyright 2021 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

404,Charles 'damaged by aide's resignation over alleged cash-for-honours scandal',"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,standard.co.uk,News,746,"NEWS,UK;Version:1",746,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Tony Jones,,METROPOLITAN BANK HOLDING CORP,METROPOLITAN BANK HOLDING CORP,Charles 'damaged by aide's resignation over alleged cash-for-honours scandal',"The Prince  of Wales's reputation has been damaged by the resignation of one his closest confidants following an alleged cash-for-honours scandal, royal commentators have said.Charles  has once again seen Michael Fawcett, who has served the royal family for 40 years, walk away from a role in controversial circumstances, but there are suspicions he may return.Mr Fawcett temporarily stood down as chief executive of the Prince's Foundation  in September when reports by Sunday newspapers alleged he had promised to help secure a knighthood and British citizenship for a Saudi billionaire donor.Former Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker  said the episode showed a ""lack of judgment"" by the future king, while royal author Penny Junor  said the aide is ""crucial"" to the prince and is likely be back in his employment.Charles's former valet resigned from the educational charity almost 20 years after he first left the prince's household following claims that he was selling royal gifts, despite an investigation finding no evidence of ""financial impropriety"" on his part.There were reports that the Duchess of Cornwall, who is fiercely loyal to her husband, wanted Charles to sever links with the former chief executive.A spokesman for the foundation said: ""Michael Fawcett has resigned from his post as CEO of the Prince's Foundation.""Mr Fawcett's party planning company will also no longer be providing services to Clarence House.When the allegations against Mr Fawcett were first made Mr Baker wrote to the Metropolitan Police asking the force to launch a criminal probe into the claims.The former MP, author of a book about royal family finances titled And What Do You Do?, said: ""I think it has damaged Prince Charles and I think it shows over the years he's shown a lack of judgment when it comes to judging an individual's character.""He speculated that Mr Fawcett could now receive a severance payment.""I would think he would certainly get some financial recompense from the prince. That's what's happened on previous occasions, I don't see why it shouldn't happen again.""And if previous behaviour is to be repeated, which it may well do, then in a few weeks or a few months, Michael Fawcett might re-emerge from the back door, back into Prince Charles's favour.""In September, the Sunday Times claimed Saudi businessman Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz, who is listed on the Prince's Foundation website as a supporter, donated large sums to restoration projects of particular interest to Charles, adding that Mr Mahfouz denies any wrongdoing.Mr Fawcett is alleged to have co-ordinated support for an honour for Mr Mahfouz, according to newspaper reports.On Thursday, Clarence House said it was ending arrangements with Mr Fawcett and his party planning company.A spokesman said: ""Michael Fawcett and Premier Mode will not be providing services to us in the future. We have all agreed to end these arrangements.""Ms Junor said of Mr Fawcett: ""I know that the prince loves him and he's indispensable to him but there has been too much scandal attached to him over the years.""She described the former royal footman as ""a bit like a boomerang or a homing pigeon"" for his ability to return to Charles and said he is ""crucial to him"".The author added: ""My guess is Fawcett will not be gone from the prince's life entirely; maybe officially, but I would almost bet my boots he will still have a role in the prince's life in some way or another.""Mr Fawcett was appointed to the role of chief executive of the Prince's Foundation in 2018 amid a reorganisation of Charles's charities.He began his career as a Buckingham Palace footman but was later accused of selling unwanted royal gifts and pocketing a percentage of the proceeds while working for Charles. He was cleared by an internal inquiry in 2003 of any financial misconduct.However, in a pervading culture among the prince's staff of accepting gifts and hospitality from outsiders, Mr Fawcett bent the rules, the inquiry headed by Charles's then private secretary Sir Michael Peat found.The royal aide resigned following the report but continued to have the prince's patronage as a freelance fixer and party planner, and picked up an undisclosed cash severance package as well as an agreement to work as Charles's events manager.

As the Cop26 climate conference draws to an end in Glasgow, David Penney, chief executive Penney Financial Partners, said businesses had a responsibility to do more to tackle the looming crisis. He said: ""The recent pandemic has been hugely disruptive to our lives but it is climate change that is the great crisis of our age and will eventually have the greatest impact on all of our lives. ""It is an issue that has to be everybody's responsibility, particularly businesses that currently account for half of all carbon emissions in the UK. It is for this reason that we have committed to become a carbon neutral business."" Businesses emit carbon emissions generated by consuming energy across its operations such as heating, air conditioning and lighting in offices, petrol, diesel and electricity for business travel and commuting and waste to landfill. Since committing to becoming a carbon neutral business at the beginning of 2021, Penney Financial Partners, which is an appointed representative of the FTSE 100-listed St. James's Place Wealth Management, has been measuring its carbon emissions every month.

406,China gains competitive advantages in greener development,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Global Times (China),News,994,,994,"China, People's Republic of",Wen Sheng,,,,China gains competitive advantages in greener development,"Climate Photo: VCGThe US and China, the world's top two emitters of carbon dioxide, unveiled a deal on November 10 at the ongoing Glasgow climate summit aimed at strengthening cooperation in the decade, tackling global climate change in tandem, including cutting the poisonous methane emissions, protecting forests and using less coal. The agreement was announced by US climate envoy John Kerry and his Chinese counterpart Xie Zhenhua, Reuters reported. The deal is commendable. It means the intense level of the dialogue between Beijing and Washington on climate cooperation begins to translate into tangible results, despite their strained political ties. The agreement was hailed by the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres as a great achievement. At the opening of the Glasgow COP26 meeting, Guterres pleaded for a genuine effort from of all countries to address their addiction to fossil fuel, warning the planet faces a stark choice -- either stop using carbon-based fossil fuels, or face catastrophic results. After witnessing the ups and downs of climate negotiations over the past years, the deal between China and the US is worth cherishing. Without an immediate and rapid effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees or 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels at the end of this century would be beyond reach, according to scientists. The Glasgow summit aims to secure net zero carbon emissions pledges and keep the Paris Agreement target of the 1.5-2.0 degrees temperature rise so that Earth will stay safe. China's central government has made two signature commitments on climate, pledging that the country's emission of carbon dioxide will peak before 2030, and the country will achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, when the amount of carbon emissions into the atmosphere will be offset by increased forest coverage and other technological breakthroughs.As the world intensifies its focus on addressing climate change, the speed of major economies in developing eco-friendly clean energies and high-tech industrial products, like solar panels and electric vehicles, will be closely watched. China leads the world in both. In addition, the nation leads in the number of other clean technology areas including hydropower generation, nuclear power, wind turbines and tidal power facilities.One of the notable achievements of China is contributing to global climate efforts is Beijing's strenuous effort to phase out traditional petrol vehicles and particularly gas guzzlers on the nation's roads. Owing to Chinese central government's preferential policies, the country's electric vehicles sale volume is expected to exceed heart-breaking 2.3 million in 2021 -- making China the single largest EV market in the world. A number of Chinese automakers have begun to send internal combustion engines to the scrap heap and are pouring billions of yuan to electric motors and batteries. Driven by the favorable taxation settings and fee policy meted out by Beijing, droves of Chinese in urban areas are being increasingly persuaded to switch to electric cars in the country's megacities such as Beijing and Shanghai. In Shenzhen, all taxi cabs and public buses are now battery-powered, with other cities like Hangzhou, Suzhou and Chengdu are catching up rapidly. With carbon emissions drastically reduced in many cities, millions of Chinese families are enjoying tangible environmental benefits. In Beijing, the number of blue sky and sunshine days has increased 34 per cent over five years ago, statistics showedAnd, the country's central bank, the People's Bank of China, has just worked out a brand-new lending tool to offer the lenders with low-cost loans to help businesses cut carbon emissions. The central bank will provide a generous package of 60 percent of loan principals made by financial institutions for carbon cuts, with a one year lending rate at merely 1.75 percent, and the loans can be rolled over twice. This new lending policy tool by the central bank is likely to produce very positive impact by inspiring Chinese enterprises to use innovative green technologies and cut emissions, while reaping more profits through access to low-cost loans, analysts say.In another push to restrict carbon emissions, China launched a landmark emissions trading market in July 2021, which will prove to be a powerful tool in its attempts to drive down climate change-causing greenhouse gases and be carbon-neutral by 2060. Considering the transaction volume, the market is now the world's largest carbon trading market.China's government is earnest in reducing carbon footprint. The country's industrial manufacturing capability sets the foundation for it to undergo a major energy structure reform, trending towards cleaner and easily recyclable energy variants. For an example, the country's 40,000-km high-speed rail system that crisscrosses all provinces, its cities and outlying villages is amongst the world's cleanest train systems.  In comparison, the US did little during the past four years of former US president Donald Trump's rule, which included several officials who labeled climate change a conspiracy theory, despite the fact that severe weather causes an estimated $100 billion in economic damage to the US each year. Trump was more interested in fighting trade wars than cutting carbon emissions to alleviate the world's climate crisis.Also, President Joe Biden's new energy spending agenda is fiercely contested and has been obstructed by the Republicans in the US Congress. High-speed trains, high-speed ubiquitous 4G and 5G wireless connections, and high-speed development of clean energy and renewables manufacturing are now catapulting China's economy to new heights. The country is, increasingly, gaining a competitive advantage in promoting greener innovations and high-quality economic growth. The author is an editor with the Global Times. bizopinion@globaltimes.com.cn ",Copyright 2021 Global Times.

China, People's Republic of",China Daily,,,,China's goodwill in climate cooperation,"Photo taken on Oct 31, 2021 shows a general view of the opening ceremony for COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland, the United Kingdom. (PHOTO / XINHUA)China-United States interaction these days has not been as constructive as it needs to be for any productive engagement. And the economic woes universally felt amid the pandemic have not been conducive to any new, significant commitments at the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, generating a generally gloomy mood.So the unveiling of a joint agreement on cooperation to accelerate climate actions and tackle global warming by the climate envoys of China and the US on Wednesday has come as a pleasant and welcome surprise to many.In the China-US Joint Glasgow Declaration on Enhancing Climate Action in the 2020s, the two parties pledged to continue working together and with all parties to strengthen the implementation of the Paris Agreement. That the two largest carbon dioxide emitters in the world have, as Chinese climate envoy Xie Zhenhua and his US counterpart, John Kerry, emphasized, risen above their other differences and decided to join hands to combat climate change is indeed a blessing not only to the Glasgow meeting, which is entering its final days without making much impressive headway, but also to the global climate response, about which many have grown pessimistic seeing the China-US stalemate.These are precisely what Beijing has insisted are part of the obligations China and the US must shoulder as ""major countries"".It is a growing consensus that the window of opportunity is rapidly closing for meaningful actions to mitigate global warming before it is too late. Any further feet-dragging will be devastating to the future of all life on Earth. It is reassuring to hear from the two key emitters that they ""recognize the seriousness and urgency of the climate crisis"", especially during the ""critical decade of the 2020s"", and will work together.The newly reached agreement on climate cooperation will certainly inspire constructive interactions between the two sides, and facilitate more sensible, responsible actions, which in itself will be a boost to the global climate response. More important, they may provide fine leadership that has exemplary impacts worldwide.It is no secret that there has been a protracted, though fruitless, blame game going on between Beijing and Washington, over but not limited to who should have done what. That they seem to have more or less returned to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities as well as taking into account national conditions represents a significant step forward.A gap exists not only between the current efforts and the Paris Agreement's requirements, but also between countries' rhetoric and actions. Hopefully, the joint will being demonstrated by China and the US can be translated into practical actions that will start to remedy this.",Copyright 2021 China Daily Information.

Fossil fuel industry emissions account for about 35 percent, waste treatment takes 20 percent, and methane emissions from agriculture and animal husbandry take 40 percent, a report released by the UN Environment Program and Climate & Clean Air Coalition in May showed.Given the special characteristics of methane, experts believe there will be plenty of room for China and the US to cooperate to reduce emissions, including policy communication, industrial standardization and technologies.Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University, said that China and the United States are expected to strengthen cooperation in areas such as clean energy technology research and development and innovative business models.However, Lin told the Global Times that while the joint declaration marks a sound first step for cooperation, the US also needs to be fair and respect China's own development plan in such cooperation efforts.""China and the US may hold meetings in the future to discuss specific cooperation details, including setting a series of standards to limit the methane produced by fossil energy and waste such as landfills and garbage disposal,"" Ma said. China and the US intend to convene a meeting in the first half of 2022 to focus on the specifics of enhancing the measurement and mitigation of methane, including through standards to reduce methane from the fossil and waste sectors, as well as incentives and programs to reduce methane from the agricultural sector, according to the joint declaration.""Limiting agricultural methane emissions, which are increasingly becoming another important source of emissions, due to the growing expansion of the aquaculture industry, will be a focus in future cooperation,"" Ma said.Before the joint declaration, China has already taken proactive approach to reduce methane emissions, including adding relevant efforts in the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-25).",Copyright 2021 Global Times.

410,Chuka Umunna: from rising star MP to ethical banker,"November 12, 2021 Friday",Non-jurisdictional,The Evening Standard (London),News,610,BUSINESS;Pg. 29,610,,Oscar Williams-Grut,,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO,Chuka Umunna: from rising star MP to ethical banker,"WHAT do you think of when you hear the name Chuka Umunna? The Labour leadership bid? The Change UK breakaway? DJING in Ibiza?Your first thought is unlikely to be ESG - the ungainly term used by bankers to describe well behaved companies. Yet that's what fills his days now.Since leaving politics in 2019, Umunna has turned to the City of London to reinvent himself as a specialist in ESG (short for environmental, social and governance). After a brief stint at advisory firm Edelman, the 43-year-old joined JPMORGAN in February to head up the bank's ESG practice in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.Umunna, who was MP for Streatham from 2010 to 2019, now spends most of his days advising big companies on how to make sure they are green, well governed, and treating people well. He's also charged with making sure JPMorgan is practising what it preaches.It's a big job: ESG was already hot but COP26 has supercharged interest in ethical and sustainable business.""There has been nothing short of a revolution,"" Umunna says when we meet on the 31st floor of JPMORGAN's Canary Wharf headquarters.The boom means Umunna has one of the busiest diaries at the bank. Finding time to meet is a squeeze.""One of the things I actually love about the role is it's just so international,"" he says. ""I've had the opportunity to go and see clients from the UAE to Germany - I was in Stockholm last week.""Is all that air travel really good for the environment?""We are conscious of that,"" he adds quickly. ""I mean, there's nowhere near as much travel [as there used to be].""Umunna still has the easy charm and charisma that made him so promising in the Commons and led the press to dub him Britain's answer to Obama. If you didn't know he was an MP, you'd think he was a lifelong investment banker.His easy waltz into the upper echelons of the City may smack of the revolving door between politics and business. But Umunna argues he's well qualified: he was an employment lawyer in the City before becoming an MP and spent four years as shadow business secretary under Labour leader Ed Miliband.""I've been involved in ESG in different forms for the last 20 years,"" he says. This is in fact Umunna's second stint at JPMORGAN - he briefly worked there at the very beginning of his career in the equity derivatives division. What Umunna is peddling now would have been regarded ""not even peripherally [but] as truly radical"" by the traders and bankers he worked with back then.""This was before the global financial crash. Things are very, very different.""What's driven this seismic shift? As with many revolutions, it's the kids.""I speak to asset managers and investors a lot,"" Umunna says. ""They're all saying things about this demographic change, this huge asset transfer from baby boomers to millennials and younger cohorts.""Young people today don't just want the family wealth to grow, they want their cash to save the world.""People who work in financial services are human beings as well,"" Umunna says. ""I've got a one- and a four-year-old and I genuinely do worry about what we will be bequeathing the future generations."" It's an alluring message but critics say it's just a sales pitch. ESG gets accused of being little more than a box ticking exercise that enables 'greenwashing'. ESG funds hold oil stocks, for example.Umunna rejects this but admits the sector has been a ""bit of a Wild West.""""The labels which were attached to products and investments were fairly liberally used. I think now there is more scrutiny, because it's a maturing market. And investors have been more demanding.""Umunna is an optimist: "" There's a big positive story to be told here.""@OSCARWGRUT",Copyright 2021 Evening Standard Limited All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|EST|ENGLISH|BANKING & FINANCEESG FACTORSBRITISH PARLIAMENTSUSTAINABLE INVESTINGINVESTMENT BANKINGCORPORATE SUSTAINABILITYSOCIETY  SOCIAL ASSISTANCE & LIFESTYLEECONOMIC CRISISSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTSUSTAINABILITYDERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS|JPMORGAN CHASE & CO|LONDON, ENGLAND|UNITED KINGDOMGERMANYUNITED ARAB EMIRATESEUROPEMIDDLE EAST|NAICS551111 OFFICES OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIESNAICS523999 MISCELLANEOUS FINANCIAL INVESTMENT ACTIVITIESNAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING & SECURITIES DEALINGNAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKINGSIC6712 OFFICES OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIESSIC6211 SECURITY BROKERS, DEALERS, & FLOTATION COMPANIESSIC6022 STATE COMMERCIAL BANKS|BALEARIC ISLANDS, SPAIN|JPM (NYSE)JPM (LSE)|ED MILIBAND|National Edition",JPM (NYSE)

We've provided electric hand tools for our ground maintenance team.""We've rolled-out double electric vehicle charging points at 11 locations around the city and we're due to deploy 8 more.""The city council is also collaborating with Cumbria County Council on the redevelopment of Carlisle Train Station, efforts are being made within the plans to improve walking and cycling connectivity.A report from a group of Northumbria University students is set to inform how the council markets its net zero strategies and engages with the public on climate change.But Cllr Alcroft said: ""Given Zero Carbon Cumbria has allocated funding for citizens panels (on climate change) to each council and they already have some in place in Barrow and Kendal I was wondering whether you could perhaps explain the executive's reluctance to hold one and have you any thoughts in advance of the report by the students on how we will engage with the public?""But the portfolio holder said that it is for the council to lead on climate change mitigation in Carlisle.Cllr Christian explained the impact humanity has had on the environment to date and said: ""We need to do something about it I think everybody must know about that by now. The Government has set out numerous plans for dealing with it and this authority has set out its strategy for dealing with it.""My point is that I don't really need anybody to tell me now what climate change is about or how we should deal with it. We're aware of that.""Neither we nor Government can take a course of action which the general supporters would not themselves support. We can demonstrate through our own actions that we really believe the Government should push forward on their plans to manage climate change.""Cllr Christian said: ""There area numerous choices before us. We can choose to buy an electric vehicle, rather than a 4X4. We can chose to implement different forms of heating in our own homes.

412,City regions teamed with business will deliver net zero,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,thetimes.co.uk,News,655,NEWS;Version:1,655,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Andy Street,,,,City regions teamed with business will deliver net zero,"When you attend a global conference on this scale, you expect to catch glimpses of the great and the good as they hurry along corridors mobbed by journalists and security guards.What you don't expect, however, is to bump into the prime minister on platform seven at Glasgow Central Station. But never one to miss an opportunity to fly the flag for the West Midlands, I joined the PM as he marched along the platform to see two West Midlands-inspired trains that had just pulled up.These trains, one designed by the University of Birmingham and the other made by Vivarail in Warwickshire, were no ordinary trains. What Boris Johnson was shown was West Midlands' manufacturing ingenuity at its finest, with one train fuelled by hydrogen and the other battery-powered.The prime minister thoroughly enjoyed the spectacle, but the message it sent was an important one: city regions like the West Midlands have a critical role to play in finding the ideas to support the global fight against climate change.Transport is the obvious example of this, which is why I was at Cop26 on ""Transport Day"" showing our leadership in this field. In the West Midlands, one third of all carbon emissions come from transport.As mayors around the world are often responsible for transport in their regions, it's safe to say that this is the single biggest contribution we can make to cutting global emissions. This means ensuring we have an extensive, environmentally friendly public transport network that encourages people to leave their cars at home.It also means making sure that the right infrastructure for cycling and walking is in place, so people can freely choose to use their two feet or two wheels whenever or wherever they wish. From new metro lines to train stations, hydrogen buses to e-bikes, we can achieve this in the West Midlands, but only with the right investment from government.The more-than-£1 billion secured in the comprehensive spending review last month is a great step forward, and shows the importance of regions working in tandem with national government.But however much progress is made through this partnership, it will never quite be enough without the private sector. They invest vast capital sums in de-carbonising transport, and their leadership and investment is just as critical in reducing emissions produced domestically and from industry.Now, this will not please those who accuse major corporations of ""greenwashing"" the climate summit: but businesses are absolutely pivotal to the global race to cut emissions. Take for example one of the West Midlands' pioneering initiatives that I've been talking about in Glasgow: net-zero neighbourhoods.We know we need to retrofit hundreds of thousands of homes, and government can provide the cash to make that happen. But retrofitting alone is not going to help transform neighbourhoods into climate-friendly communities.That's why our plan is to pair this retrofitting work with other practical steps such as LED lighting, communal farming, pocket parks, and electric vehicle charging points to create - you guessed it - net-zero neighbourhoods.But how do we bring our plans to life? By partnering with the private sector. Just yesterday we announced that, by working with the private sector, global built-environment consultancy firm Arup, we will be delivering our first net-zero neighbourhood in Wolverhampton. This will be a genuine partnership between the public and private sector.From Presidents Xi to Biden, Prime Ministers Modhi to Johnson, all the focus these past two weeks has been on the world's leaders making their pledges as to how their country will do their bit.But for citizens, they are asking how their home in Dudley will be insulated, or how their electric car will be manufactured in Coventry. From my experience at Cop, I am clear that it is city regions that must deliver.

The first minister said the accusations about Drew Hendry and David Linden - which they have strongly denied - may be an attempt by the Conservatives to distract from other issues.Speaking to journalists at COP26, Ms Sturgeon said: ""I think there have been allegations made against two of my MPs that they say are completely false and unfounded, and some may say is an attempt by Conservatives to distract attention from their own travails.""I know Drew and David well, they say these allegations are unfounded and that is something I've got confidence in.""The saga began with reports that SNP MPs Mr Hendry and Mr Linden and Labour's Charlotte Nichols had been drinking heavily and were rude to staff on the flight to Gibraltar. They were among a group of 15 MPs who flew out onTuesday to join the visit organised by the parliamentary armed forces scheme.In a statement, Mr Wallace said: ""This behaviour puts military personnel in a difficult position and risks undermining respect for Parliament.""The SNP, however, said the whole incident raised serious questions about the conduct of Mr Wallace in the original attempt at ""silly political point scoring"".""Ben Wallace must apologise for abusing his role as UK defence secretary to attack other parties ahead of Armistice Day,"" an SNP spokesman said.""""

Bosses are terrified that Humm will leave if his demands are not met, which would mean they would be without him during the Christmas season, their busiest time of year.But if they turn the restaurant vegan, they will upset thousands of regular guests.'Humm (pictured) recently made headlines around the world by turning the £250-a-head menu at his three-Michelin-starred New York restaurant, Eleven Madison Park, totally plant-based.There, diners can enjoy dishes including cucumber with melon and smoked daikon; fried pepper with Swiss chard; and courgette with lemongrass and tofu.Meanwhile, the four-course menu at his Claridge's restaurant, Davies And Brook, costs £125 a head and includes such mouth-watering options as caviar with sweet potato bonito and English muffin; roasted venison with beetroot; and, of course, foie gras with black truffle.A Claridge's spokesman confirms that it's in talks with Humm over his request, telling me: We are constantly reviewing the offerings at Davies And Brook, including the possible introduction of a fully plant-based menu.'However, my sources claim this diplomatic response merely hints at tensions behind the scenes.This week, Humm, 45, made an appearance at the Cop26 eco summit in Glasgow, where he pointedly declared his mission in life was to make plant-based food delicious, magical and luxurious'.He added: It's better for our planet and our health.'While such a dramatic switch might please a trendy young crowd, Claridge's will be aware of the maxim: Go woke, go broke.'  ***  UNTIL recently, chest binders an item of clothing used to flatten  the breasts weren't part of the mainstream lexicon. But the topic has come to the fore this year, thanks to the ongoing transgender debate and the third series of Netflix hit Sex Education, which features a character diminishing their breasts with bandages. A few months ago, Emma Corrin, best known for her Golden Globe-winning turn as Princess Diana in The Crown, caused a stir by sharing photos with boxing wrap tied around her torso, captioned: Some time before I bought my first binder.' Those in support of binders say the garment not only helps people pass as the gender they wish to identify as but aids their mental wellbeing. But how would you feel if your child insisted on wearing one? Here, in a bravely candid account, author Clare Macnaughton, 49, from Warminster, Wiltshire, describes how she felt when her teenager, Macc, 13, who identifies as  non-binary (neither female nor male), started wearing a chest binder six months ago, while Macc responds below?.?.?.  Clare says: Macc was born a girl, who loved long hair, ponies and dolls and was never a tomboy, so pre-puberty, there were no signs my child might one day reject, and want to disguise, their female form with a chest-binder.It was early in the first lockdown, as we were driving back from the stables, where Macc has ridden from the age of six, that the idea was first mooted. Macc announced: I'm just trying to work out what gender I am.' To say I was shocked would be an understatement. I answered: Well, it's not like Woolworth's pick and mix, you don't just choose one. If you've got gender dysphoria [the sense of unease a person may have because of a mismatch between their biological sex and their gender identity], then that's quite a serious issue and needs to be explored.  We don't just go: “Oh, you know, today I'm feeling like a boy.” Or maybe we do, but this isn't a casual conversation we have on the way back from horse-riding. It's a big thing.' Macc has told me since that my reaction was upsetting, that it felt unsupportive, and as a result they retreated into themselves for a while before feeling comfortable enough to raise the subject again.  As for me, I told myself it was probably just a phase, triggered by a combination of the onset of puberty and the weirdness of the pandemic. The first time I encountered a chest binder was in August that year. We went to our house in Limousin, France, with a friend and her child who was transitioning from female to male and wore one. I didn't ask many questions, or pay it much heed, as I didn't want to embarrass the child. Then, around this time last year, over dinner one evening, Macc announced to the family: I don't feel like a girl any more, nor do I feel like a boy which makes me non-binary. Please stop using my birth name [now referred to as a dead name'] and call me Macc.' It is the name of a horse at the stables, but also a derivative of our surname, a bit like a nickname, which made it easier. Having spent the previous 12 years raising a daughter, adapting to Macc's requested pronouns, they and he, was hard and I still slip up today and say she'. Macc always puts  me right, but is  also understanding. I'm no Hyacinth Bouquet', I like to think I'm pretty free-thinking, but even I struggle to get my head around it all though I know I must, for the sake of my child. It probably looks harder to cope with, emotionally, from the outside, but teenagers present all kinds of challenges, and go through phases. Macc's dad and I agree the most important thing is to stay strong and supportive. The last thing we want is for this to lead to a mental-health crisis. Also, we've adapted to the changes in our child in stages. In the preceding months, Macc's long hair was cut into a bob it's now short, spiky and red and Macc wore only androgynous clothes, including trousers, instead of a skirt, as part of their school uniform, so the transition felt gradual. But I hadn't even thought about binders until this May when Macc said: Mum, I hate my breasts! Please can you buy me a binder?' No parent likes to think of their child as being unhappy with their body, but I told myself Macc was just rejecting the more inconvenient trappings of womanhood, periods and breasts. I might have done the same at that age, if I'd felt it was an option, though the older I've got, the more I've embraced and enjoy my femininity.  I wondered if Macc had created this non-binary personality to protect themselves from societal pressures, once you hit puberty, to be sexual. Macc says I'm wrong, that it's who they are'. Teenagers rarely think their parents are right about anything, of course. Still, as a feminist, I struggle with Macc rejecting being female by chest binding, but also understand why someone may want the advantages that come with presenting as male, and feel the need to be rid of some of the aspects of being female that can make life harder and girls more vulnerable. All of these thoughts were whirring around my head. However, when it comes to teenagers we also have an 18-year-old son who now lives away from home I've learned it's best not to over-react to the point they dig their heels in.  So, while I would never attempt to forbid something like this, I wouldn't be instrumental in it either. Macc gets £30 a month for pocket money, so I said: If you want to buy a binder, you've got pocket money and that's what it's there for, to buy things you choose, for yourself.' That same evening Macc ordered a £12 black chest binder from Amazon a tight crop top-style garment in heavy, bodice material, with hooks and eyes down one side, that fits tautly and flattens the chest. It was delivered a couple of days later and, in the interim, I did some Googling and was a little alarmed by what I read. Logic dictates that, if you strap down a body part that's not meant to be strapped down, it can't be good for you. And binders can, if worn incorrectly or for too long, lead to chest or back pain, bruising and even rib fractures, shortness of breath, skin damage and over-heating. To avoid these risks, the advice is to limit wearing them to no more than eight hours a day and to have at least one full day a week binder-free. I relayed this to Macc, who promised to never exceed the recommended wear-time, and I have good reason to trust that promise. Like the rest of the family, Macc has always opted for comfort over fashion and loves to get straight into pyjamas. The first time I saw the binder, Macc was going from bedroom to bathroom, dressed in it and a pair of shorts. It wasn't a shocking, or repulsive, sight to me as it looked like a shiny vest and, as Macc is not yet very well-endowed, there's not much to hide. Friends have been very supportive, though Macc's  non-binary status is not something we really discuss with extended family. Macc told the head of house at school about the name change and new pronouns I explained that this was their journey and I wasn't going to be the one to initiate these steps and Macc was referred to a counsellor. Once it was established that Macc was committed to these changes, I was asked for written permission for the changes to the register, which I gave.  People often ask me if we are grieving for the daughter Macc no longer wants to be and, the truth is, we chose the birth name we gave them because we loved it, so it's sad our child doesn't want to be called that any more. However, in terms of the person that Macc is becoming, binder and all, it's just an evolution of the person they were. We've had 18 months to adapt and our child is still very much here.  I never had fantasies about big weddings with me the mother-of-the-bride I'd rather my children travelled and Macc is planning on one day moving into a commune on a smallholding in Scotland with other non-binary people. I want my children to have the freedom to do and be whatever they want, but I've also explained that we are currently living in a very supportive bubble, of home and school and, once Macc is out in the world, people may not be so accepting.  About a week ago, as I was tucking myself into bed one night, Macc came in and said: Yeah, I'm gonna cut my t**s off.' Macc meant have surgery at some point in the future, rather than a drastic act of self-mutilation, but I still said: I think you'd regret it, but this is not a conversation to be had at ten at night.' I wouldn't sanction any transitioning treatments no testosterone, no drugs, no surgery while I have parental responsibility for Macc. If that's something they want when they're 18, they can make that decision as an adult. I brought the subject up when we were in the car, a few days later saying: It would cost £5,000 per breast, so, if you had £10,000, would you have your breasts cut off or would you buy a horse?'  Macc said they've wanted a horse for longer than they've wanted their breasts removed in fact, they once put together a whole PowerPoint presentation to try to convince me to buy one so a horse it would be.  I'm grateful that Macc's love of horses is a constant throughout this challenging time, as they are such mood-lifters. I think the introspection that comes with constantly questioning one's gender is unhealthy, even narcissistic at times, and the beauty of horses is that they force you to be outward-looking.  Who can say how Macc is going to feel about all of this, and whether the binder will still be there, in a few years' time?  All I know is that my child still loves horses and wants to dress the Christmas tree again this year in the way we've always done it. So, for the moment, all we're dealing with is a teenager who's calling themself by a different name and binding their chest. Macc says:  Mum likes to say that I'm rejecting womanhood by binding my boobs. But, in fact, my feelings are much stronger than that: I actually hate having them and can't bear looking at myself naked any more. Even though my chest is not big, I can't even glance at myself in the mirror when I'm dressed, unless I'm wearing a binder. My shape is naturally quite feminine with curvy hips and thighs, so I like to wear baggy clothes that hide all that. I feel like my natural shape should be more boyish, straight up and down, and so that's the illusion I want the binder to help create. The irony is that, initially, I was really excited when (aged 11) I started growing breasts. I had been the only person in my friendship group who wasn't developing at all some of my friends had already got their period and I felt like a late bloomer. But then (aged 12), I realised I was a lesbian although I don't use that term now because it is feminine and I am non-binary and the thought of being with a boy is gross. So I started dressing more masculine, in joggers and hoodies, to make myself more attractive to girls. Before long, I started to hate my body, hate the feminine parts of myself, and started asking: What if I don't want to be a girl?' I decided I didn't, but didn't want to be a boy either.   I knew someone who came to France with us who wore a binder, but I didn't know what they were for. It was after I saw a video on TikTok about binders, and discovered they were to compress your chest, that it all made sense. I hated my boobs, I didn't want them, so I thought: I'll buy a binder and get rid of them.' There are nights where I feel I hate myself and feel better with the binder. In fact, I feel euphoric when I have it on. It creates the illusion of how I want to look, how I want to feel in my body.   I wear it for school most days but I can't for PE. I tried once, but started wheezing I couldn't breathe properly and had to stop.   I've heard there can be risks and I can feel it compressing my lungs when I put it on as tight as possible. So, as long as I avoid doing that, I'll be OK. I don't wear it for more than eight hours at a time and at home I can go without it, if I don't look at my chest, so I don't get rashes or sores. When I'm riding I can't wear it, as it interferes with my breathing. But I wear a chest protector, which stops you from breaking your ribs if you fall off. They're tailored to your body, so kind of flatten your chest, which is good. I'm probably the smallest bra size possible, an A cup, but I'm terrified about them getting bigger and harder to hide, but hopefully the binder will still work. As soon as I can, I'll have them removed thinking about that makes me feel excited for the future. I'm going to move to Scotland and have loads of fun and I won't have t**s any more.  When I picture myself as an adult I'm wearing androgynous clothes, cargo pants and hoodies, and will definitely have they' in my pronouns. He' might come after. I just don't want she' at all.  And, until I can have the surgery, I'll wear a binder. I don't need to think about breastfeeding in the future because I don't want to get pregnant. If I have children, I hope my partner will carry them. My friends are really positive and supportive most of them are in the LGBTQ+ community, too, so they happily use my new pronouns and name. My class has also been amazing. They all call me Macc, never by my dead name, and use he/they/them pronouns.  The only negativity I've experienced came from the older year groups. My friends and I stand near where the year-ten kids hang out and we've been called names by some of them. They've stopped now. I think they got bored because they didn't get a reaction. Mum says that I'm living in a protective bubble and have to be prepared to encounter bigoted people in the world. I tell her that's one reason my binder is so important to me: when I'm wearing it, I'm not defined by the female gender I was born with and, if people assume I'm a boy, so be it. If they take the time to ask, I will, of course, tell them I'm non-binary.

'Bosses are terrified that Humm will leave if his demands are not met, which would mean they would be without him during the Christmas season, their busiest time of year.'But if they turn the restaurant vegan, they will upset thousands of regular guests.'Humm (pictured) recently made headlines around the world by turning the £250-ahead menu at his three-Michelin-starred New York restaurant, Eleven Madison Park, totally plant-based.There, diners can enjoy dishes including cucumber with melon and smoked daikon; fried pepper with Swiss chard; and courgette with lemongrass and tofu.Meanwhile, the four-course menu at his Claridge's restaurant, Davies And Brook, costs £125 a head and includes such mouth-watering options as caviar with sweet potato bonito and English muffin; roasted venison with beetroot; and, of course, foie gras with black truffle.A Claridge's spokesman confirms that it's in talks with Humm over his request, telling me: 'We are constantly reviewing the offerings at Davies And Brook, including the possible introduction of a fully plant-based menu.'However, my sources claim this diplomatic response merely hints at tensions behind the scenes.This week, Humm, 45, made an appearance at the Cop26 eco summit in Glasgow, where he pointedly declared his mission in life was 'to make plant-based food delicious, magical and luxurious'.He added: 'It's better for our planet and our health.'While such a dramatic switch might please a trendy young crowd, Claridge's will be aware of the maxim: 'Go woke, go broke.'To keep up to date with the latest royal news and gossip, sign up to my weekly newsletter www.mailplus.co.uk/palace-newsletter",Copyright 2021 Associated Newpapers Ltd.

418,Climate anxiety at Cop: 'Being here makes me more worried',"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Guardian (London),News,805,ENVIRONMENT;Version:1,805,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Oliver Milman in Glasgow,,,,Climate anxiety at Cop: 'Being here makes me more worried',"After an exhausting two weeks of speeches, protests, meetings and increasingly tortuous negotiations at the Glasgow climate summit, a sense of simmering frustration and anxiety has gripped many of the 25,000 attenders.Even former world leaders are not immune. ""There are times where the future seems somewhat bleak,"" said Barack Obama on Monday.  ""There are times where I am doubtful that humanity can get its act together before it's too late, and images of dystopia start creeping into my dreams.""The initial text  of the climate agreement to be thrashed out by negotiators has done little to ease the anxieties of activists and delegates who wanted to see a major breakthrough to contain disastrous global heating. ""Things are still missing from that text and the clock is ticking, it has added to the fear and anger,"" said Alexis Pascaris, an environmental policy researcher and activist from Michigan, who added that the climate crisis had, as with many other young people around the world , made her question whether she should have children.""To procreate seems hypocritical,"" she said. ""If I am bringing up another mouth to feed, that will involve more trees being chopped down and more gasoline being pumped. I tend to think: 'Am I allowed to add to this mess?'""I feel dismal and sometimes disempowered. I got into this thinking I'm going to save the world and now I would say maybe I'd inspire one or two human beings because I don't think large-scale change is feasible. There is this underlying anger, but we have to turn that into action.""For many of the delegates, the looming threat of climate catastrophe is rooted in tangible danger rather than more abstract fears. Maina Talia , a delegate from Tuvalu who took a week to travel from the small Pacific island nation to Glasgow, said his feeling of anxiety ""is more than what Obama is talking about"".""It's part of us now, it's in us,"" he said. ""It's an everyday reality for us, the fear for what the future will look like for us, our kids. There is anxiety and fear, particularly when there are high tides. The water is rising, the waves are crashing against our doors.""The nightmare scenario for Tuvalu and other vulnerable countries is that sea level rise wipes them almost completely off the map.  The future viability of certain countries is to some degree being decided in front of anguished representatives in a cavernous convention centre perched on the banks of the River Clyde.""It seems if no action is taken by the international community, we will have to move,"" said Talia. ""We want to stay on our island, practice our culture. Some of the people are listening to our plea for survival but this is like a game to the oil-producing nations. What can we do?""Anxiety over the climate crisis appears to be growing, especially among younger people, but differs between countries, experts say. Lisa Page, a climate specialist at the Royal College of Psychiatrists - who prefers the term "" eco distress  "" as anxiety is a more clinical term - said young people in the UK often feel fearful over their future and guilty over their role, while their counterparts in Africa are more likely to feel angry and a sense of injustice.""You hear from younger people that they are really worried about this, it causes them at times to feel quite hopeless, depressed and fearful,"" Page said. People exposed to climate-driven disasters such as floods and hurricanes could have lingering mental health effects even several years after they happened, she added, with escalating conflict, food insecurity and forced migration set to cause further distress as the world continues to heat up.For those not in immediate life-altering danger, Page said it was important not to view worries about the climate as pathological and to understand such concerns are rational responses to bad news.""It's not possible to say to young people 'it's not going to be that bad' because the science is saying the opposite - it may even be worse,"" she said. ""The first thing is to acknowledge that these are overwhelming problems and your ability to counteract them is limited. There is hope, though, so maybe link with other people talking about this, join movements that advocate for higher change. Knowing it's valid to feel this way is helpful.""For those within the realm of Cop26, however, the experience of being alongside thousands of others worried about the climate crisis has not been entirely restorative. ""Being here makes me more worried because this Cop isn't very inclusive, those on the frontlines of climate change aren't here to tell their stories,"" said Makoma Lekalakala , a delegate from South Africa.""There is a lot of trauma, people who don't have access to water, people affected by natural disasters, and we cannot bear it any more. We wonder if anyone is listening at all.""","Copyright 2021 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

419,"Climate change a challenge, opportunity for Hong Kong","November 12, 2021 Friday",International,China Daily (Hong Kong Edition),News,1053,,1053,"Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China
China, People's Republic of",Mervyn Cheung,,,,"Climate change a challenge, opportunity for Hong Kong","With the United Nations warning that global heating will spiral ""faster than expected"" in the coming two decades, around 100 political leaders from around the world gathered last week in Glasgow, Scotland, to tackle the rocketing climate crisis.Organized by Britain, this UN Climate Change Conference (COP26 climate summit) aimed to achieve net-zero carbon emissions, or carbon neutrality, and retain the 2015 Paris Agreement, which limits temperature rise from 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius as an attainable goal by 2100 to resolve the threat of growing global warming.Yet the congregation of world leaders this time was eclipsed from the outset by the incessant political maneuvering by the incumbent United States administration, which dampens its ties with China.Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered a written speech at the summit. Probably in an attempt to stall a further decline in the American image over the forsaking of the climate missions by the Trump administration, US President Joe Biden seized the opportunity to swipe at leaders of China and Russia, but not his Indian counterpart — a US ally — over their absence from the climate summit.Biden's remarks drew a rebuttal from China's top climate envoy, Xie Zhenhua, who said at the summit that it was the US and other developed nations that should be tasked for faster emissions cuts. He rejected claims that China should carry obligations for the damage to the Earth's climate, holding that it was a default on the part of Donald Trump, whose withdrawal from the Paris accord had slackened follow-up efforts considerably. To him, it was time to ""work harder and catch up"" on the backlog of actions thus created. Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson opined that China's delegation to the summit was sufficiently high in level to engage in the deliberations.With China being noted internationally as the first country declaring clearly the goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, Xie emphasized that China ""honors the promises (on climate change) with real action"", instead of with flowery words, as some other countries did. In this regard, it is realized with global interests that China is assisting developing countries through the South-South Cooperation on Climate Change Programme, in which China has invested $188 million covering 40 cooperative projects in 35 countries.Despite the Global Methane Pledge reached in Glasgow — enlisting countries accounting for half of the world's methane emissions — and the US climate envoy's marketing of optimism on coal removal from energy generation, thousands of protesters took to the streets of Glasgow, voicing objections to the climate conference for its perceived failure to produce the necessary breakthroughs in containing the climatic extremities battering the planet. Rally speakers lamented the politicians, businesses and environmentalists participating in the summit for failing to act fast enough to curb global warming and serve the interests of especially the vulnerable communities in countries that have made a negligible impact on climate change.To shore up collaboration, the muddle over the climate threat has first to be broken off by the US, which hatched it up through relinquishing its leadership role by pulling out abruptly from the Paris Agreement. This is particularly relevant since Biden has boasted of both his ""profound impact on the way"" to reach the stipulated temperature targets and how well ""the rest of the world is looking at the US and its leadership role."" Yet there are grounds to believe that any deliberate attempt by Biden to persist with the current hawkish stance on China, and Russia as well, is most unlikely to yield any avail to the pressing climate-induced complications.With the frightful invasion of super typhoons in recent years, Hong Kong must be sufficiently prepared for the vigorous fight against rising temperatures and the associated climate disaster. Residents must understand that the city on its own cannot stay clear of weather calamities, and that mitigation, adaptation and resilience strategies are of vital importance for meeting goals on climate change.The SOS stage has been reached for protecting the local environment by going for greener life habits. In the face of the pervading effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the widespread adoption of take-away dining styles in Hong Kong and its consequent problem of discarded plastics in our waste disposal system, the authorities must assume the need for giving proper direction and incentives to its effective management. At the proactive end, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government is expected to ramp up efforts to educate the public about the looming climate crisis and its adverse impact so as to enhance the local community's preparedness and resilience in combating climate-driven concerns.The Chinese central government is reported to have issued earlier this week development directives reiterating the incorporation of sustainability and determination to curb pollution in production processes. It is logical for Hong Kong to step onto the same pathway to a shared future in a new era. Given the overarching objective of achieving modernization within a sustainable context, Beijing is eyeing a significant green transition in an economy targeting high-quality growth. Banking authorities on the mainland are understood to be putting up monetary policy tools to aid green energy development.With China occupying the second-largest share, the world market for green bonds stands currently at a total value of $300 billion, and is heading for an estimated value of $1 trillion in two years. The HKSAR government started this financial market segment in 2015 and accumulated thus far a total value of $3.5 billion. There is substantial room for expanding this financial market segment, especially through the offer of green bonds in renminbi. For benefits to Hong Kong and contributions to the national 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25), it certainly pays for the HKSAR government to catch up by capitalizing on its talent, technology and the declared support from the central government to lead the win-win drive.The author is a member of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macao Studies.The views do not necessarily reflect those of China Daily.",Copyright 2021 China Daily Information.

The Briton, 23, grew up on a farm in Kent, three hours' drive away from the Bovington army base where next month she'll fight for the inaugural title in the all-electric off-road racing series, which bills itself as ""the first sport built out of concern for the climate crisis.""Ushuaia, Argentina was originally set to host the first season finale, but Covid-related cancellations forced organisers to search for a new location. They landed in Dorset.Munnings (right) has especially appreciated the opportunity to work with and learn from Extreme E's scientific advisors, led by Professor Peter Wadhams, head of the Polar Ocean Physics Group at Cambridge. She has become a voracious reader.She said: ""I was reading a book the other day about how different the world could look by 2050, and it actually really shocked me, because it's not really that far away now.""Extreme E has sped up my process of learning about it.If we could have some kind of compulsory learning for everyone, not just at a school level, but just to really get the facts out there.""I think people would be quite shocked as I have been since I've been exposed to it in much more detail this year.""Munnings partners Timmy Hansen on Andretti United, one of the series' nine teams—all of which must have one male and one female driver—who sit in third place heading into the Bovington finale, named the Jurassic X Prix.McLaren has already pledged to enter a team for next season, unveiling Emma Gilmour as its first-ever female driver at COP26 last week.This week Munnings is at the Glasgow summit, hosting panels for the National Grid about the move to electric vehicle use. And Munnings, who re-signed with Andretti United this summer, could return to Scotland next year with Extreme E, after chancellor Rishi Sunak pledged £1 million toward a race in the Outer Hebrides last month.The Jurassic X Prix, said Extreme E founder Alejandro Agag, is ""a poignant shift in our mission to race in remote places to highlight the effects of climate change, as more increasingly, the issues we talk about are happening in our backyard.""So while the latest venue doesn't sound as exotic as the series' maiden race in the Saudi Arabian desert or as obvious a choice as Greenland's melting Russell Glacier, perhaps it's actually the most extreme of the bunch - at least in its simple, authentic admission that climate change is a crisis affecting everyday Brits.""It is a surprise to be racing in England this year and potentially Scotland next year,"" added Munnings. ""When I thought of Extreme E I thought of, as it says on the tin, travelling to some of the most remote locations that have had effects from climate change.""I'd probably been quite ignorant in my past, and seen it as kind of problem that's happening in wildfires in Australia, or rising sea levels in other parts of the world, and not necessarily something that's on our doorstep.""",Copyright 2021 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

A8,445,Ontario,The Associated Press,,ASSOCIATED PRESS,ASSOCIATED PRESS,"Climate goal on 'life support,' UN chief says","United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 F) is ""on life support"" as UN climate talks enter their final days, but he added that ""until the last moment, hope should be maintained.""In an exclusive interview on Thursday with The Associated Press, Guterres said the negotiations set to end Friday in Glasgow, Scotland, will ""very probably"" not yield the carbon-cutting pledges he has said are needed to keep the planet from warming beyond the 1.5-degree threshold.So far, the talks have not come close to achieving any of the UN's three announced priorities for the annual conference, called COP26. One is cutting carbon emissions by about half by 2030 to reach the goal Guterres alluded to.The other two are getting rich countries to fulfill a 12-year-old pledge of providing $100 billion a year in financial climate aid to poor nations and ensuring that half of that amount goes to helping developing nations adapt to the worst effects of climate change.Guterres said the Glasgow talks ""are in a crucial moment"" and need to accomplish more than securing a weak deal that participating nations agree to support.""The worst thing would be to reach an agreement at all costs by a minimum common denominator that would not respond to the huge challenges we face,"" Guterres said.That's because the overarching goal of limiting warming since pre-industrial times to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 F) by the end of the century ""is still in reach but on life support,"" Guterres said. The world has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit), leaving far less than a degree before the threshold is hit.Less than 36 hours from the scheduled close of the negotiations, Guterres said that if negotiators can't reach ambitious carbon-cutting goals - ""and very probably it will not happen"" - then national leaders would need to come up with new pledges next year and in 2023 during high-level meetings.He said it is ""very important"" that nations update their goals and send top leaders to the climate talks every year, at this point. However, Guterres would not say at what point he thinks the 1.5-degree goal would have to be abandoned.""When you are on the verge of the abyss, it's not important to discuss what will be your fourth or fifth step,"" Guterres said. ""What's important to discuss is what will be your first step. Because if your first step is the wrong step, you will not have the chance to do a search to make a second or third one.""Guterres said he agreed with youth climate activists who called for the UN to term global warming a ""climate emergency"" of a high level and treat it as such.",Copyright 2021 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

The action plan further includes the creation of standards for evaluating batteries for EVs so they can more easily be bought and sold secondhand.It also stipulates that the participants will cooperate in bolstering supply chains.Electric vehicles can operate for a shorter period of time on one charge than their gasoline-powered counterparts can on a full tank. It also takes at least 30 minutes to charge a battery.As rare materials are vital for enhancing the functionality of batteries, the action plan focuses on establishing a system to ensure stable procurement of these materials from China, Africa and elsewhere.",Copyright 2021 The Yomiuri Shimbun All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|ELECTRIC MOBILITYELECTRIC VEHICLE INDUSTRYELECTRIC VEHICLESSUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATIONSUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT|BATTERIESELECTRIC MOBILITYELECTRIC VEHICLE INDUSTRYELECTRIC VEHICLESSUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATIONMANUFACTURING|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|JAPANCHINAGERMANYUNITED STATES",

She has a good claim to be Glasgow's most thoughtful recent visitor. Dies Irae is the livewire violinist's musical response to climate change, centring on the medieval plainchant of the ""Day of Wrath"" in the Mass for the dead. As you might guess from the title, it doesn't contain much to be cheerful about.The music culminated in Galina Ustwolskaja's 1970s recomposition of the Dies Irae, for eight double basses and piano, Kopatchinskaja laying down her violin to strike out nihilistic hammer blows on a coffin-shaped wooden box. On the way to the Day of Judgment, war breaks out. Kopatchinskaja played Heinrich Biber's 1673 Battalia with string principals from the Royal Scottish National Orchestra, the lithe energy of her playing galvanising her colleagues into something brusque and exciting. But this was no genteel baroquerie: Biber's music melted into painful dissonances and chaotic shouting, entropy encroaching as a sign of the looming apocalypse.Interspersed with this battle, the movements of George Crumb's Black Angels, a response to the Vietnam War, sounded like the music for a horror film, while Antonio Lotti's Crucifixus, sung by students of the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, floated in, a voice from another world.The playing was great, but it was scarcely the point. Kopatchinskaja created a piece of plotless theatre that was designed as an assault on the senses, including warning sirens, an attacking battalion of trombones and, most poignantly, a finale consisting of dozens of metronomes, slowly winding down to darkness as mankind's time on Earth runs out.As a piece of drama the evening packed a powerful punch. It was bizarre to the point of surrealism, and at times made very little sense; but maybe, horrifyingly, that's the point.

No,"" he said on Friday morning, before laughing.At the conclusion of the G20 meeting in Rome, Macron told assembled media that he ""knew"" Morrison had lied when asked if he thought the leader of Australia's centre-right Coalition government had lied over the cancellation of a $90bn submarine contract Australia had held with France.Morrison's predecessor as prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, was quick to back Macron's characterisation, telling reporters at the Cop26 conference his former treasurer ""lied to me on many occasions"".""Scott has always had a reputation for telling lies,"" he said.Since then, Morrison has been forced to defend his record, a prospect made more difficult as he attempts to re-position his government's climate record after almost a decade of obstruction and denial.The Labor opposition has seized on the prime minister's discomfort, accusing him of ""lying about lying"" as Morrison attempts to re-write some of his previous public comments on issues such as electric vehicles and the Australian vaccination roll out.During the last election campaign, Morrison rubbished electric vehicles as being unable to tow boats or trailers and accused the opposition of wanting to ""end the weekend"" , after Labor set an aspirational target to encourage EV uptake in the sluggish Australian market.In launching his own government's electric vehicle push earlier this week, which includes a threadbare policy aimed at expanding hydrogen refuelling infrastructure and assisting the private sector in setting up charging stations, Morrison denied he had ever criticised EVs.Morrison claimed he had ""never"" attacked electric vehicles, despite his on-the-record comments, and wrongly insisted there had been a ""massive change"" in the technology in the 950 days since he made the original comments.It was the same tactic he deployed when faced with questions over his repeated claim Australia's vaccine rollout was ""not a race""  - a comment he made on multiple occasions earlier this year  as Australians struggled to access a Covid vaccine.Scrambling to deflect criticism over his government's role as much of Australia laboured under a Delta earlier this year, Morrison denied he had been speaking about the vaccine program itself and had been referring to regulatory approval (despite the vaccines having already been approved when he made the comments).","Copyright 2021 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

440,Dalmahoy junction gets scaled-back upgrade after residents waited 35 years for improvements,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Edinburgh Evening News,News,599,"TRAFFIC AND TRAVELCOUNCILEDINBURGH, FIFE AND LOTHIANS",599,Scotland,Ian SwansonN/A,,,,Dalmahoy junction gets scaled-back upgrade after residents waited 35 years for improvements,"Let us know what you think and join the conversation at the bottom of this article.The junction on Dalmahoy Road, which includes the entrance to the hotel and country club where US president Joe Biden stayed during his visit to COP26 last week, is a notorious accident blackspot.And in 2015 a council report said a fully-signalised junction was the only practical option to improve safety.But the project was delayed, costs increased and the council came forward with a redesign. The Evening News reported in June on the residents' dismay at the scaled-back plans and a decision was postponed.Some changes have been made, including a realignment of the road, but the plans now approved are for a signalised pedestrian crossing rather than a full-signalised junction.The council claims the new scheme, which also includes a 30mph speed limit, will have a similar impact in reducing collisions but will cost £625,000 instead of £962,000.Resident Ben Bright told the committee an earlier council report had highlighted safety risks with a pedestrian crossing, including drivers not seeing the lights and buses stopping on the carriageway increasing the danger of head-on collisions.And he said a lot of the extra cost of the scheme was about tackling drainage issues rather than road safety.Judy Wightman of Ratho and District Community Council said: ""In 2016 we were promised signalised traffic lights for both pedestrians and motorists and we were very relieved that something we had first asked for in 1986 was coming to fruition. It wasn't until February 2021 that our hopes were dashed.""And she said without enforcement, it was unlikely a 30mph limit would have more than a minimal impact on speeding traffic.Tory transport spokesman Graham Hutchison told the committee the pedestrian crossing scheme was not what the community had waited all these years for. “It’s frankly a poor use of public money and it’s not delivering the road safety improvements.”  And Lib Dem Kevin Lang said while there were “endless amounts” available for big changes in the city centre, when it came to rural areas there was never enough money. But convener Lesley Macinnes said there was a choice between holding off and hoping for the full scheme or taking action now. “Let’s go with what we've got, with the budget we know we can deliver rather than put it off and try to find more money, having to cut projects elsewhere.”Tory councillor for the area, Graeme Bruce, said the scheme was a half-baked solution that offered little or no value for money and possibly presented more danger to users of the junction rather than making it safer.“Why on earth would you spend £625,000 on a pedestrian crossing when you could spend just over £300,000 more to have a fully-signalised junction to make it safe for all road users including pedestrians? It’s an absolute ‘no brainer’ to spend the extra money to get this right first time.“The SNP says it takes money from other projects. Do they not think it’s the turn of the local residents at the junction, in Ratho and outlying communities to have some proper funding for road improvements? They’ve only been waiting 30-40 years.”Read more: Plans to scale back on promised safety measures at Edinburgh accident blackspot postponed for talks with communityA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this article.

441,"David Lonsdale: Retailers making great strides on climate, but we are not there yet","November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Herald Scotland,News,606,,606,Scotland,,,T J MAXX,T J MAXX,"David Lonsdale: Retailers making great strides on climate, but we are not there yet","COP26 is almost behind us. It\xE2s been exhilarating to see so many countries come together in Glasgow to deliver tangible progress and momentum towards tackling climate change. The attention will now rightly turn from the lofty rhetoric and fresh commitments made in Scotland\xE2s largest city to what each of us must do.For retailers, the route forward is clear \xE2 we must continue to build the low-carbon retail industry of tomorrow, regardless of the myriad immediate pressures facing the sector today.Imagine for a moment a future where the environmental impact of every purchase is calculated for us at point of sale. A future where our receipt offers us not only the financial cost of our purchases, but its carbon footprint as well. Where we recycle much more alongside our old clothes and glass bottles? Where we repair our broken-down electronics rather than replace them? Where waste is frowned upon and packaging is shunned?We\xE2re not there yet, but retailers are already making strides, offering refill zones and more. The speed of change in retail remains breakneck, but it is essential that stores continue to respond to customer demands for more ethical and sustainable goods.Twelve months ago, retailers came together under the banner of the retail consortium\xE2s \xE2Climate Action Roadmap\xE2 with the aim of making the industry and its supply chains carbon neutral by 2040. Given retail and consumers account for a sizeable slice of all carbon emissions, there is both a huge opportunity and massive responsibility on the industry. It will require action from retailers, suppliers, employees, and customers.Today, 80 leading retail brands \xE2 including the likes of Schuh, Scotmid and TJ Maxx \xE2 have not only committed collectively to putting climate action at the heart of their decision-making, but have started out on the journey to achieving it. It won\xE2t be easy, especially as these firms have pledged to decarbonise stores by 2030, deliveries and logistics by 2035, and products by 2040 while helping customers to live low-carbon lifestyles.As the industry\xE2s trade body we\xE2ve spent the past year ensuring these firms have the tools they need.We formed a taskforce under the leadership of the head of the Co-op to drive progress and benchmarking performance against the highest standards; published detailed guidance for retailers on achieving net-zero vehicle logistics and on helping customers to live low-carbon lifestyles; and held workshops offering practical assistance on sustainable sourcing, green data and technology, and decarbonising store estates.Retail is taking its responsibilities seriously. Even before the industry roadmap, it led the way, reducing the environmental impact of its own operations and supporting improvements in the supply chain and with customers. Examples include eliminating microplastics, cutting water usage, removing packaging, refitting stores to be more energy efficient, and working to implement a deposit return system for drinks containers. Earlier this year, we reported how retailers have already cut greenhouse gas emissions by 49 per cent since 2005.Shoppers tell us they want brands to help them make better choices, and are prepared to back their ethics with their custom.Changing the way we operate is never easy \xE2 it will require huge investments of time and money, and a supportive framework from Government. Ultimately, however, it makes good business sense. Retailers see themselves as part of the solution and are determined to bring about the zero-carbon future we all need.David Lonsdale is director of the Scottish Retail Consortium",Copyright 2021 NewsQuest Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|T J MAXX|CLIMATE CHANGEGREEN SUPPLY CHAINSPOLLUTION & ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTSPRODUCT PACKAGINGSOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE & LIFESTYLEBUSINESS & PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONSETHICSCARBON NEUTRAL INITIATIVESCONSUMERSEMISSIONSENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCESENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGYRETAIL SECTOR PERFORMANCESUSTAINABILITYBENCHMARKINGCORPORATE SUSTAINABILITYENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINTENERGY EFFICIENCY & CONSERVATIONSUSTAINABLE PRODUCTSGREENHOUSE GASES|RETAIL & WHOLESALE TRADERETAILERSGREEN SUPPLY CHAINSPRODUCT PACKAGINGMEDIA & TELECOMMUNICATIONSCARBON NEUTRAL INITIATIVESEMISSIONSENERGY & UTILITIESRETAIL SECTOR PERFORMANCEENERGY EFFICIENCY & CONSERVATIONSUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|SCOTLAND",
442,Deal helps to lighten mood for the future,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Sydney Morning Herald (Australia),News,405,NEWS;Pg. 12,405,Australia,Nick O'Malley,,,,Deal helps to lighten mood for the future,"Glasgow: China and the United States have boosted the global climate talks with their joint statement, quelling lingering fears that the summit might end in failure and opening the door to the acceleration of a global green economic transition.It doesn't mean the work of COP26 is done, just that there are fewer roadblocks to achieving success now that the statement has been made.The specific goals of the British hosts are to shift the world's attention to the more ambitious Paris Agreement goal of holding warming to 1.5 degrees, to drive members of the agreement to increase ambitions in keeping with such a target, and to set a timeline on ending the use of fossil fuels.In reality, none of these objectives were ever going to be achieved over 10 days in Glasgow, but if the summit is to succeed, momentum towards these aims needs to quicken, potentially making positive shifts inevitable.The China-US joint statement is an accelerant.Crucially, it endorses both the focus of the summit on driving ambitious action before 2030 rather than relying on mid-century targets, and on the primacy of the 1.5-degree goal over the 2-degree goal also found in the Paris Agreement but no longer seen as sufficient to save some nations.It does not, however, specifically mention the fossil fuel phase-out, nor calls being made by some voting blocs here to have countries such as Australia that have not improved their 2030 targets return next year to do so.Where the joint statement does delve into specifics, it is on areas where there is little contention - sharing of green-tech expertise, smoothing out regulations and concrete action on reducing methane emissions.But the statement's significance does not lie in its detail, rather in its weight.When these two nations act, said the Climate Council's chief researcher, Simon Bradshaw, geopolitical gravity shifts.The statement also defuses the greatest threat to the talks, which had been the finger-pointing between the two nations - China accusing the US of failing to act on its pronouncements, the US accusing China of being absent from the talks and reluctant on the issue.The rift had been giving cover to smaller parties with an interest in retarding climate action, says Byford Tsang, a China specialist with the global climate think tank E3G, also observing the talksin Glasgow.That cover is gone, or at least reduced, and the mood in Glasgow considerably lighter as a result.",Copyright 2021 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|AGREEMENTSCLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION & POLICYGREEN ECONOMYEMISSIONSGREENHOUSE GASESENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGYRESEARCH INSTITUTES|ENERGY & UTILITIESGREEN ECONOMYEMISSIONSMETHANE|GLASGOW, SCOTLANDSYDNEY, AUSTRALIA|CHINAUNITED STATESAUSTRALIA",
443,Deep trouble: Tuvalu wants to stay a nation even if the rising sea levels drown land,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),News,392,NEWS;Pg. 12,392,England & Wales,STUTI MISHRA,,,,Deep trouble: Tuvalu wants to stay a nation even if the rising sea levels drown land,"Pacific island nation Tuvalu is exploring ways to keep its recognition as a state even if it loses all its land to rising sea levels.Simon Kofe, the foreign minister of Tuvalu, said the country was planning for the worst and looking into keeping the ownership of its maritime zones. ""We're actually imagining a worst-case scenario where we are forced to relocate or our lands are submerged,"" he said yesterday.Pacific island nations are at the forefront of bearing the brunt of the climate crisis as extreme weather events spike and sea levels rise. Many island nations, including Tuvalu and Kiribati, have already lost land to increased water levels. ""We're looking at legal avenues where we can retain our ownership of our maritime zones, retain our recognition as a state under international law. So those are steps that we are taking, looking into the future,"" Mr Kofe said.Earlier this week, in order to emphasise the impact of climate change on the island nation at the Cop26 summit, Mr Kofe delivered a video address standing in knee-deep water on an area of land that had been recently submerged due to rising water levels. Images and videos of Mr Kofe standing in a suit at a lectern set up in the sea with his trousers rolled up have been shared widely on social media.Reacting to the response to the video, Mr Kofe said: ""We didn't think it would go viral as we saw over the last few days. We have been very pleased with that and hopefully that carries the message and emphasises the challenges that we are facing in Tuvalu at the moment,"" he added.Tuvalu is at the risk of becoming one of the first nations to be significantly impacted by rising sea levels due to global climate change. The average height of its islands is less than two metres above sea level and its highest point is about 4.6m above sea level. The nation consists of nine islands in the Pacific region and has a population of some 11,000 people. It has been witnessing an average of 0.5cm rise in sea levels every year for the last 28 years, which is taking up its land area.Tuvalu's leaders earlier said that vacating the land in case of extreme weather will be their last resort. Mr Kofe also stressed that the older generation of the island nation want to go down with the land. ""The one thing clear is that the people have a very close tie to their land,"" Mr Kofe said.",Copyright 2021 Independent Print Ltd All Rights Reserved,,Newspaper|IA|ENGLISH|News|CLIMATE CHANGEISLANDS & REEFSINTERNATIONAL RELATIONSINTERNATIONAL LAWSTATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICESSEVERE WEATHERWEATHERVIRAL VIDEOSNEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS|VIRAL VIDEOS|TUVALUKIRIBATI,
444,Defence pact needs love from Joe,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Australian,News,1003,THENATION;Pg. 6,1003,Australia,"Greg Sheridan, COMMENT",,,,Defence pact needs love from Joe,"US national security adviser Jake Sullivan is like the circus cleaner with a bucket following around the elephant cleaning up the mess the big guy just made.In this case Sullivan gave a rapturous rendition of what the AUKUS agreement might mean, in an obvious effort to move -beyond the sour taste left by President Joe Biden's bizarre remarks that the agreement had been clumsy and he was so sorry the French hadn't been told, and that he even, wrongly, thought Paris had been informed.Sullivan also joined a strange and temporary unity ticket with China's President, Xi Jinping, who told APEC that the region must avoid ""a new Cold War"".Sullivan says the US, too, wants to avoid a Cold War with China. But whereas Xi thinks ""small exclusive groups"" - namely AUKUS - promote Cold War thinking, Sullivan thinks AUKUS will help prevent a Cold War by keeping the region stable.Meanwhile Xi and Biden showed that, at the end of the day, they are both politicians, as they joined together in one of the vaguest, least impressive, most undemanding, ethereal, Latinate joint statements on climate action yet, in that richly populated field of content-lite climate declarations.Sullivan, a widely respected foreign policy professional, was expansive about what AUKUS meant, and spoke to the Lowy -Institute in the best traditions of American rhetorical generosity about Australia and our alliance with the US.This alliance, he said, ""is fundamental to our vision"" and he meant the Washington vision for the whole globe and across all -foreign policy issues.The Biden administration was hard at work implementing AUKUS, Sullivan said. AUKUS showed that ""if you are a strong ally and friend of the US and you bet with us, we'll bet with you, with the most advanced, most sensitive technology we have"".And: ""We trust you, we believe in you."" These are exceptionally welcome words from Sullivan. They will reverberate throughout Asia and will be read with intense interest in Beijing, and indeed in Paris.But it remains the fact that from five minutes after AUKUS was announced Biden himself has said nothing about it other than to repeatedly apologise for it, has said nothing positive about Australia, and has shown no interest in meeting Scott Morrison when they were together at international forums.It is surely the most bizarre presidential follow up to an allegedly historical alliance agreement in US presidential history.The Biden guys think of themselves as the polar opposite of -Donald Trump's administration.But the AUKUS sequence reprises a recurring motif of the Trump years. The President says something weird, disobliging or just unfathomable, and then the senior officials scramble around to say, no, what the President actually meant was just the opposite of what he said.This has happened more than once in the Biden administration. Sullivan also refused to say whether it was Australia, or his own officials, that Biden had in mind when he talked about how clumsy the AUKUS process had been, and how he, Biden, had been misled about the treatment of France.Reports are that it was Sullivan himself, and Indo-Pacific Co-ordinator Kurt Campbell, who caught the lion's share of Biden's wrath, but Sullivan's determined failure to exempt the Morrison government from Biden's criticisms leaves a lingering suspicion that the President thought Canberra had messed up as well as his own officials.Sullivan and Campbell both are great friends of Australia and we are lucky to have them in the Biden administration. But nothing counts as much as the President's own words.There was also a singular lack of specifics in Sullivan's vision for AUKUS. It's about nuclear propelled subs and other emerging technologies, he said.But as the Morrison government keeps insisting these notional nuclear subs will be built in Adelaide, we know they are decades away from delivery at best. And we already have the closest partnership imaginable with the US on military technology.So where's the beef, Jack?Nonetheless, Sullivan's speech indicates the Biden administration has at least the rudiments of something the Morrison government completely lacks - a -communications strategy for AUKUS. That is to say, at least one senior official has made one speech with some AUKUS material in it.The Biden/Xi joint statement on climate is hopeful, in that it shows the two superpowers talking, and having some wish to co-operate at least on a statement, but it is also the kind of statement which makes people cynical about international politics.The big story of COP26 is that it failed because the big emitters ether didn't show up - China, Russia, Brazil - or didn't make any significant change to their old positions, as in the more understandable case of India.Here's an undeniable truth - if the countries responsible for the majority of emissions don't reduce them, global emissions overall won't reduce. And China continues to increase its emissions. The dance by both Xi and Sullivan around the terminology of ""Cold War"" followed well rehearsed, deeply familiar, long-choreographed lines.Beijing wants to get US forces out of Asia so it opposes ""outside interference"" in the region. And it wants to weaken US alliances so that it can bully its Asian neighbours one-on-one, so it demonises US alliance structures as ""Cold War thinking"".At the same time, Washington doesn't want to be blamed for regional conflict so it frequently repeats the mantra that it doesn't want a Cold War.There is not now a Cold War between the US and China. The term Cold War arises from US/Soviet Union tensions and includes mutual economic disdain if not isolation. US/China trade, by contrast, is still huge.Nonetheless, both countries are decoupling in critical hi-tech areas. Intensified Chinese authoritarianism is scaring away many foreign investors.

Their statement is so ambivalent it may mean everyone has 10 years to deforest the planet before they do some serious tut-tutting?Whatever they meant, the fact is they cannot stop any sovereign nation from clear-felling all its forests.Trees perform more vital functions than simply absorbing carbon.

While we do not think of buildings and installations as sustainable, they have a significant impact on the environment. Indeed, living and workspaces can be designed to be more resource efficient while offering modern aesthetics and comfort.The panel members highlighted possibilities for sustainable residential, commercial, and industrial spaces in Bangladesh building on the progress achieved thus far.Attendees from government bodies, top real estate developers and architects, and Danish companies engaged in discussions on how simple technologies, such as energy efficient water pumps and ventilation systems, can be integrated into buildings for more sustainable urbanization.On the second day of the exhibition, the panellists unpacked the 'Future of Sustainable Apparel Production.'Panellists on day three of the exhibition spoke on the 'Sustainable Future of Food.'

Cyclists ride through town in climate demo,"CYCLING enthusiasts put pedal to the metal around Bridport to raise awareness of global warming and to keep politicians 'on their toes'.A total of 60 cyclists, including some children and the mayor, cycled a circuit within the town centre last Saturday to coincide with Cop26 (2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference), as well as demonstrating a carbon-free way of travelling.Led by Bridport mayor Ian Bark, the cycling convoy started at 11.30am next to the Bridport Football Club car park, then onto South Street, then into East Street and onto West Street - before finishing the route back at the football ground's car park.The bike ride was organised by environment groups across Bridport, including Bridport Tree Planting (BTP) and West Dorset Friends of the Earth.BTP co-ordinator and bike ride committee member, Joe Hackett said: ""The majority of the public took to it well.""There was no arguments although there were a few delays for motorists, but we were very careful not to cause too much hassle.""We went through a consultation process with the town council to hold the event.""Bridport is an environmentally concious town, which is why I think the public were happy with what we were doing.""Scott Morrison, chairman of West Dorset Friends of the Earth, said: ""It was a quiet and friendly demonstration about how serious the situation is.""We had to show local people that we must keep up pressure on negotiators to save our environment and secure a future for generations to come.""Mayor Ian Bark said: ""Much of the technology to deliver a low carbon future already exists, and the speed with which it is delivered needs to accelerate rapidly across the globe if we're to avoid environmental catastrophe.""These days with the advent of electric cycles even more people could and should be using cycling as their number one choice.""Even when on a shopping trip the addition of panniers to your bike means you do not need always to use your car.""Mr Hackett added: ""We have to get involved when and where we can and to keep politicians on their toes.""My advice to those that may disagree with environmental concerns is to research about the damage being made to the planet.""I don't think there's a case of denying the effect our actions are having on the environment anymore.""",Copyright 2021 NewsQuest Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved,,Newspaper|ENGLISH|FRIENDS OF THE EARTH|CYCLINGBICYCLESCITY GOVERNMENTENVIRONMENTAL & WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONSCLIMATOLOGYCLIMATE CHANGEENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCESGLOBAL WARMINGNEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSCITIESREGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTSPOLLUTION & ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTSDELAYS & POSTPONEMENTSLEGISLATIVE BODIESUNITED NATIONSUNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONSENVIRONMENTAL ACCIDENTS & DISASTERS|BICYCLESGLOBAL WARMINGPARKING SPACES & FACILITIES,
449,Digested week: £3m to call yourself a lord looks good value for the mega-rich,"November 12, 2021 Friday",Non-jurisdictional,The Guardian (London),News,1569,POLITICS;Version:1,1569,,John Crace,,THALES SA,THALES SA,Digested week: £3m to call yourself a lord looks good value for the mega-rich,"                                        Monday                                      If I were to stumble on a £3m windfall, I wouldn't be making a donation to the Tory party. I'd get each of the kids somewhere to live, buy a couple of Jennifer Lee pots along with first editions of Brighton Rock and The Great Gatsby, treat myself to a couple of opera away weekends somewhere in mainland Europe, and put the rest aside for a rainy day. But for the mega-rich, donating to the Conservative party  - or philanthropy , as George Eustice, the environment secretary, put it - seems quite a cheap way of sharp-elbowing your way into positions of power. The Sunday Times reported that a £3m donation and a token stint as party treasurer was enough to guarantee a seat in the House of Lords. Which actually seems extraordinarily good value at the price. If you've got more than £100m in the bank - and the Conservatives know plenty who have - then you'd barely notice £3m sliding out of your account. And for that you get to call yourself Lord and pick up all sorts of other perks that come with the title. It's time the Tories showed the upper house some proper respect and moved the entry bar into the tens of millions.                                        Tuesday                                      Most of us like to think we have a fairly functional inbuilt bullshit detector. That we can tell when people are talking rubbish. But a new study  by Canadian and Israeli academics, published on the PsyArXiv  website, suggests we may be more gullible than we thought. Much of our willingness to attribute meaning to something that sounds as if it is nonsense depends on who we think said it. Bill Gates and Michelle Obama we take seriously. Kim Kardashian and Richard Nixon not so much. Take the idea that ""we live not, in reality, on the summit of a solid earth but at the bottom of an ocean of air"". If you were told that this came from a Hallmark inspirational greetings card, you'd probably have been inclined to dismiss it immediately. But if you were told it was actually said by the philosopher and mathematician Thales of Miletus, one of the Seven Sages of Greece, you'd have given it the benefit of the doubt. You might even have found it meaningful, despite it not making much sense. It turns out that ""pseudo-profound bullshit"" studies - the willingness to attribute truthfulness to nonsense - are a fast-growing area in psychology: PsyArXiv has at least six other papers devoted to the subject published this year. What no one seems to have yet been able to determine is whether those who are regular bullshitters are better able to detect it in others. Nor does it seem clear whether bullshitters are always aware they are talking bullshit: it is genuinely possible that Donald Trump and Boris Johnson believe most of what they say. It also seems likely that your receptivity to bullshit rather depends on how desperate you are to believe it. When I was in the mental hospital this summer, some of the therapists used new age language that my normal cynical self would have rejected. But when I was on my knees I didn't question it. Maybe I'm just shallow.                                        Wednesday                                      Our youngest is 26 today. Happy birthday, Robbie. I couldn't be more proud of the person he has become, as he's far more caring and sorted than I was at his age and is the type of young man I would have liked to have been. But his birthday does make me feel ancient. It's not just that the years seem to be slipping by faster and faster - though I can still vividly remember bringing him home from hospital after he was born, wondering if I was going to be a good enough dad to him and his sister: it's also that me having adult children feels absurd. A category error. I don't feel ready to be this old. Then, maybe I should take lessons in the ageing process from my 97-year-old mother. When I visited her in the care home last weekend she informed me that she didn't think she was going to make old bones. This from a woman who survived being machine-gunned by a Messerschmitt - she tells me she can still hear the sound of the bullets hitting the road beside her - as she was running for shelter during an air raid on Portsmouth where she was serving as a Wren in the war. And who only last year managed to contract the mildest form of Covid, when many others of her age were not so lucky. She was more upset at being placed in self-isolation, with the carers bringing her food in full PPE, than she was by her symptoms of a slight fever and cough. Even so, she didn't look as if she entirely believed me when I told her she already had made old bones. I just have to hope I have her genes rather than my father's. He died of heart failure when he was 77.                                        Thursday                                      Parliament is on a two-day recess and no one I've asked has any idea why. After all, it was only about a month ago that the Commons was on recess for a week, so it can't be because MPs need some more time off. The only logical explanation is that some MPs have fallen behind on their second jobs  and need a few days to catch up. Much of the investigation into MPs' outside earnings has focused on the jaw-dropping £1m that Geoffrey Cox  has raked in over the course of the last year, but two other Tories have also caught my eye. The first is Chris ""Failing"" Grayling, who makes an extra £100k a year as a strategic adviser to Hutchison Ports. This has to be a joke. What sea-faring operation would hire a former transport minister who awarded a £13m contract to a ferry company that was planning to operate out of a port that was not designed to take any ferries? Even if it had any, which it didn't. The other MP to come to my attention is Ben Bradley, who the register of interests says works 30 hours a week as leader of Nottinghamshire county council and 30 hours a week as a member of the executive board of East Midlands Councils. That's five 12-hour days working outside parliament. Presumably he saves weekends for his constituency work. The register also says he earns £600 a year from East Midlands Councils, so it's safe to assume he's not in it for the money. And that he's never heard of the national living wage. The cabinet had been due to spend one of their two days off on a special management away day at Chequers - I've always wanted to go on one of these - but had second thoughts after no one wanted to be shot in the back by Boris during the afternoon paintballing session. Instead, they were holding a cabinet meeting in London where they were to discuss levelling up. Perhaps they could get some input from Cox via Zoom from Mauritius.                                        Friday                                      Cop26 is due to end today but Boris Johnson's press conference earlier in the week, when he returned to Glasgow  for a couple of hours, was remarkable for his declaration that the UK was ""not remotely a corrupt country"".  Hardly the most reassuring of statements as he urged world leaders to make one last effort to reach a meaningful climate agreement, since it had all the conviction of someone trying to persuade his wife he wasn't having an affair. Practice doesn't make perfect in Boris's case, because since then the media's focus has been on all the ways Britain is a corrupt country. Paid lobbying , trying to undermine the standards commissioner , cash for honours, signing the Northern Ireland protocol in bad faith  and the prime minister's financing of the redecoration of his Downing Street flat  and accepting a free holiday  from someone he had put in the Lords naturally all took centre stage, but the UK's refusal to pay back £400m to Iran  - Richard Ratcliffe is now on the 20th day of his hunger strike  as part of his heroic struggle to get his wife, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, released from Iran (don't forget it was Boris Johnson's failure to read his brief that was partially responsible for her remaining in prison) - could be added to the charge sheet. The debt dates back to the 1970s when the UK refused to deliver the remaining tanks it had promised and for which it had already been paid when Iran became a theocracy. Clearly the ethical thing to have done would have been just to return the unspent money. After all, that's what would have been expected of any legitimate commercial business. Instead the UK has been fighting and losing court cases not to pay the £400m. When Ratcliffe brought up the subject in a recent meeting with the Foreign Office, he said the junior minister James Cleverly just clammed up. The Iranians report that our excuse is sanctions prevent us repaying the dosh, even though the central bank of Iran is not a sanctioned body. If the problem is that we just don't have the cash, then maybe the government could just flog off another 150 peerages. That should cover it.

Some less than successful than others.Brian Shaw, Philip Kenyon, Robert Jardine, Ronnie Callender and Joe Glass all attempted responses with topics ranging from COP26 to Hallowe'en.First to the rostrum was John Kerr with his offering of Made to Measure. This was a comfortable stroll through John's life as an ""expert"" and enthusiastic DIY demon.This was helped by his agricultural background which has continued into his retirement.His speeches are always enthralling as he speaks about what he knows and includes some comedy element which this time centred on municipal waste disposal.As usual from his background his DIY exploits resulted in saving a substantial amount of money but judging by his speech, he is now an expert in toxic waste removal.John is a relaxed and accomplished speaker and a great start to the speeches.Next up was John Cannon with RomanRoad. John shocked members by claiming to own and operate an iPad and being able to track flights, particularly those of world leaders to and from www.Rome.No this was not a COP talk it was the history and route of the Roman road throughout our region from the Border to his native Galloway.The research, detail and knowledge he imparted was second to none as he led members through the region.He has experience of the route of this road as he and his trusty plough have disrupted it occasionally but no more to be said on that.Completing the evening was Alistair Stevenson with Cut above the Rest. Alistair introduced Senga, his mannequin hair model.He then spent the next 10 minutes introducing everyone to all his ""clients"" at Glasgow's premier hair salon. Of course, Alistair knows when to open a hair salon in Glasgow. All the world leaders visited and all requesting various styles.Alistair has a style of his own when it comes to speaking and even he managed to juggle holding a speech, a comb, a pair of scissors and at times a telephone.His talk was clever and amusing albeit hectic and busy.Annandale Speakers meet every other Thursday at 7.30pm at Lockerbie Bowling Club.",Copyright 2021 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|DGS|ENGLISH|National Edition|AGRICULTURAL WASTESHALLOWEENHAZARDOUS WASTETOXIC & HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES|HAIR STYLING SERVICESAGRICULTURAL WASTESWASTE MANAGEMENT & REMEDIATION SERVICESHAZARDOUS WASTETOXIC & HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|SCOTLAND",
451,Don't add to growing mountain of e-waste,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Sydney Morning Herald (Australia),News,397,OPINION;Opinion;Pg. 33,397,Australia,Veena Sahajwalla,,,,Don't add to growing mountain of e-waste,"World leaders have spent almost two weeks working out how to combat climate change but, as COP26 draws to a close today, one key issue is yet to be addressed: turning waste into a resource. And this is something all of us can tackle.Electrification powered by renewable energy will play a crucial role in reducing emissions but the infrastructure required is made from materials we dig out of the earth. These are finite and increasing in cost. Growing demand for electric vehicles, solar systems and batteries to run our devices puts pressure on these resources. But recovering valuable materials from waste will ease this pressure.The UNSW Sustainable Materials Research and Technology (SMaRT) Centre has shown we can reform materials embedded in various waste batteries, such as cobalt and nickel. And e-waste materials that contain copper, manganese, zinc and various rare earth elements can also be recycled and reformed with technologies developed or being developed by the SMaRT Centre.In just five years, the volume of discarded smartphones, laptops, printers and other electronic devices has jumped 21 per cent worldwide. This e-waste reached 53.6 million metric tonnes in 2019, an average of 7.3 kilograms a person. The United Nations predicts global e-waste will reach 74 million metric tonnes by 2030, with most of it ending up in landfill, stockpiles and even in incinerators.We need to learn to value our materials and question our throw-away mentality. It is good to see new government policies to protect rare earths (such as neodymium, found in computer hard drives) and a renewed focus in government to better manage our waste, recycling and manufacturing resources.But a recent report from Infrastructure Australia found recyclable waste is ending up in landfill because of constraints on its collection and processing, including product design and lack of demand. That report highlights the urgent need for new waste and recycling infrastructure.The new Australian Research Council Microrecycling Research Hub that I am heading aims to address this need. Enabling onshore, sophisticated waste processing, recycling and reformation of waste as a resource must be central to global electrification and is integral to Australia's prosperity.Professor Veena Sahajwalla is the director of the UNSW SMaRT Centre and spoke at the Herald Sustainability Summit yesterday.",Copyright 2021 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|ELECTRONIC WASTEMATERIALS RECOVERY & RECYCLINGLANDFILLSSUSTAINABILITYWASTE REDUCTIONREPORTS, REVIEWS & SECTIONSCLIMATE CHANGEGOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTOUTPUT & DEMANDRENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRYPUBLIC POLICYEMISSIONSUNITED NATIONSELECTRIC MOBILITYSUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATIONELECTRIC VEHICLE INDUSTRYELECTRIC VEHICLESUNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONSEDITORIALS & OPINIONS|BATTERIESELECTRONIC WASTEMATERIALS RECOVERY & RECYCLINGLANDFILLSWASTE REDUCTIONMANUFACTURINGSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTALTERNATIVE & RENEWABLE ENERGYRENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRYSOLAR ENERGYWASTE MANAGEMENT & REMEDIATION SERVICESEMISSIONSENERGY & UTILITIESELECTRIC MOBILITYSUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATIONELECTRIC VEHICLE INDUSTRYELECTRIC VEHICLESLAPTOP COMPUTERSMOBILE & CELLULAR TELEPHONES|SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA|AUSTRALIA",
452,Don't be fooled - net zero isn't same as zero emissions,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),News,623,NEWS;Pg. 11,623,England & Wales,CAROLINE LUCAS,,ROYAL DUTCH SHELL PLC,ROYAL DUTCH SHELL PLC,Don't be fooled - net zero isn't same as zero emissions,"There's been a lot of self-congratulation at Cop26 as more countries commit to net zero emissions. The boast is that more than 80 per cent of the global economy is now covered by a national net zero target.But that little word ""net"" is having to do an awful lot of heavy lifting. At best, there's too much reliance on it. At worst, it's an accountancy trick giving people the impression of climate action when in reality it's business as usual, with catastrophic consequences for people and planet.For a start, nearly all net zero pledges are for mid-century or beyond - whether they come from governments or corporations. That is far too late to respond to an accelerating climate emergency.Even the supposedly more ambitious pledges made in Glasgow bring us nowhere near the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global heating to 1.5C. The analysis from Climate Action Tracker is that we're currently heading for a catastrophic 2.4C rise in average global temperatures by the end of this century. We need urgent, deep cuts in emissions this decade, not a ""burn now, pay later"" approach.The other danger is what lies behind the net zero pledges. Where the focus should be on cutting emissions this decade, countries and corporations instead plan to continue burning fossil fuels for decades while claiming they're taking climate action with a range of tricks, often including untested technological innovations such as carbon removal schemes.Perhaps even worse, too many companies are taking the easier option of offsets like tree plantations, reforestation and afforestation when instead they should be transitioning away from fossil fuels altogether. Planting trees will not deliver the transformational change that we urgently need to prevent climate breakdown.No-one denies that we need to protect and grow more trees. But mass tree planting as a form of offsetting is leading to indigenous peoples in the global south being pushed off their ancestral land so that it can be planted with trees to allow a corporation in the global north to claim it is reaching net zero emissions.This needs to be called out for what it is: climate colonialism. People who are already suffering the worst impacts of the climate crisis despite having done least to cause it, now face having to pay twice to address it. Far from addressing climate injustice, this multiplies it.Nor is it a practical solution - the amount of land required for tree planting to offset emissions is almost unimaginable.Take just one example. The oil giant Shell says it plans to reach net zero by 2050, offsetting 120 million tonnes of CO2 by planting forests. According to ActionAid, the land required would be no less than 12 million hectares by 2030 - three times the size of the Netherlands. And all the while, Shell plans to continue investing in oil and gas exploration, pumping carbon into the atmosphere.Shell is just one of six oil majors in the world. There is simply not enough cultivable land for all these emissions to be offset by tree planting when that land is also needed to grow food and for biodiversity.It is a vast pretence, and a cover to allow corporations to carry on with their business as usual, polluting while claiming to be taking action on the climate crisis. So no more magic maths. Instead of relying on unproven and often untested technological innovations such as carbon removal schemes or tree planting, emissions have to be cut to real zero, not net zero. Nations and corporations which have done most to damage the climate need to take responsibility, be far more ambitious with emissions cuts and support those communities in the global south which are suffering the worst impacts.Caroline Lucas is the Green Party MP for Brighton Pavilion",Copyright 2021 Independent Print Ltd All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|IA|ENGLISH|ROYAL DUTCH SHELL PLC|NAICS447110 GASOLINE STATIONS WITH CONVENIENCE STORESNAICS325110 PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURINGNAICS211130 NATURAL GAS EXTRACTIONNAICS211120 CRUDE PETROLEUM EXTRACTION|RDS.A (NYSE)RDS.A (LSE)RDS.A (EUR)|News|EMISSIONSCARBON NEUTRAL INITIATIVESCLIMATE CHANGENEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSAGREEMENTSCARBON OFFSETSGLOBAL WARMINGGLOBALIZATIONBUSINESS NEWSECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORSFORESTS & WOODLANDSTIMBER TRACT OPERATIONSREFORESTATIONINDIGENOUS PEOPLES|EMISSIONSCARBON NEUTRAL INITIATIVESENERGY & UTILITIESCARBON OFFSETSGLOBAL WARMINGOIL & GAS INDUSTRYFORESTRY & LOGGINGTIMBER TRACT OPERATIONSREFORESTATION|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|NETHERLANDS",RDS.A (NYSE)

The European Union's negotiator Maros Sefcovic is expected to tell his British counterpart David Frost that the negotiations will fail unless the British Government drops its ""unattainable"" demand over the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ). He is to warn that Downing Street needs to ""take a step"" towards the EU for the talks to be ""meaningful"". The meeting in London comes against the backdrop of British warnings in recent weeks that it could trigger article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol. Sources in Dublin said that back channel efforts aimed at finding solutions to the impasse are ongoing. Positive note Senior Government figures struck a positive note in public comments yesterday amid indications that Britain has stepped back from triggering article 16. Taoiseach Micheál Martin told Today FM: ""I do believe that in the last number of days there's a sense of an easing of tension and dialling down the momentum towards invoking article 16 of the protocol."" Separately, speaking in the Dáil, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said efforts will continue to ""dissuade the British government from triggering article 16 which I believe would be a really serious, negative and retrograde step"". He said he had spoken this week to one of US president Joe Biden's most senior advisers and also to members of Congress attending the Cop26 summit in Glasgow including Democratic member of congress Brendan Boyle. Mr Coveney said: ""The main focus is to try to encourage progress"" in the discussions between Mr Sefcovic and Lord Frost. He said he had listened to what Lord Frost had to say in the House of Lords on Wednesday and added: ""I think there is still some time to try to ensure that negotiations and partnership can work."" Only option Lord Frost told the House of Lords that article 16 would be Britain's only option if talks with the EU failed but he promised to continue to negotiate for a number of weeks. He urged the EU to ""stay calm and keep things in proportion"". There is concern in Brussels that the British government has already decided to trigger article 16 in the coming weeks. Retaliatory actions are being prepared with options up to suspending the trade deal agreed last year believed to be under consideration. The UK is insisting that the protocol needs a more fundamental redrafting including the removal of the European Court of Justice from its role as arbiter of EU law. ""We think that the objectives set out by the UK are unattainable,"" said a senior EU official. ""The UK position is that the role of the EU's institution needs to go . . .

It is truly sickening and in this year of COP26 the deafening silence of the local ‘Save the Planet’ enthusiasts is a little disconcerting. Where are these people when they are needed?

455,Eamonn Holmes to 'leave This Morning for GB News',"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,standard.co.uk,News,466,"NEWS,UK;Version:1",466,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Barney Davis,,,,Eamonn Holmes to 'leave This Morning for GB News',"Eamonn Holmes is reportedly set to quit This Morning to join GB News.The host's decision to join the news network has reportedly infuriated ITV bosses and comes after he branded Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, ""woke and weak"" and refused to dismiss a 5G conspiracy on the show.Weeks later the 61-year-old, and his wife Ruth Langsford, were dropped from their prime Friday slot and replaced by Dermot O'Leary and Alison Hammond -but the couple often covered holidays.A source reportedly told The Mirror on Friday: ""Eamonn's move to GB News marks the end of an era.""He'll be missed by many ITV viewers but, the truth is, this job offer probably came at just the right moment for both him and ITV. All good things come to an end.""Holmes will be offered his own show appearing several times a week starting in the New Year, according to the source.When GB News launched in June, Eamonn said: ""We need a shake-up on the news front. I have huge respect for TV news but this is a reminder news is not just Westminster or a constant woke agenda.""He is the latest big-name signing for the troubled GB News after Nigel Farage joined and chairman Andrew Neil stepped down, saying he will never again appear on the network.The network has struggled to attract audiences with regular slots ranking too low to appear on official ratings.Holmes attracted the kind of controversy that GB News thrives on when he ranted about Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, telling journalist Dawn Neesom on Talk Radio: ""She is playing the role of her life. I just find her incredibly irritating.""Ms Neesom said she'd never met Meghan, before Holmes replied: ""I've never met her -but I look at her and I think 'I don't think I'd like you in real life.'""He went on to describe Meghan, and said: ""You're just that awful, woke, weak, manipulative, spoilt... what I have met is lots of people in TV series and movie stars from America who are mollycoddled beyond belief with PR people around them, and maybe she is just somewhat spoilt.""Holmes also had to issue an on-air apology after promoting a 5G conspiracy on breakfast television.The host had stated it was ""very easy"" to dismiss the conspiracy theory that there is a link between Covid-19 and the technology ""because it suits the state narrative"".Speaking to presenter Alice Beer, who had branded the unfounded theories ""stupid"", Holmes said: ""I totally agree with everything you are saying but what I don't accept is mainstream media immediately slapping that down as not true when they don't know it's not true.""Eamonn Holmes has been contacted for comment.

It said the homes will fulfil demands from \xE2local people and communities which are growing and thriving.\xE2 The housebuilder, which was established 85 years ago, said work would now begin on new developments at Winton View in Tranent, Carberry Grange in Whitecraig, Station Brae in Maddiston, Victoria Wynd in Kirkcaldy, and Calderwood in East Calder. Each are said to be located \xE2within reach of Glasgow and Edinburgh\xE2.The plans come after Miller, owned by private equity player Bridgepoint, boosted its land bank with the acquisition of Wallace Land Investments.READ MORE:\xC2Drive to net zero in freight industry highlighted during COP26Land director David Morgan said: \xE2These are key acquisitions, meeting the needs of local people and communities which are growing and thriving. They are all in prime locations, within reach of cities like Edinburgh and Glasgow, and will provide high quality homes for families of all sizes. Current demand for new homes in these areas is incredibly high and we look forward to playing our part in what is, for many, a significant new chapter in the stories of their local communities.\xE2The developments will offer a range of styles and sizes, the company said.The project at Calderwood will be the second phase of Miller\xE2s development in the area.Winton View will have 99 three to five bedroom homes.

It will support a research and development (R&D) project for Innovo’s autonomous wind, solar and hydrogen fuel cell powered surface vessel, called Oceandrone.Designed by the company’s team of engineers and naval architects, Oceandrone uses a combination of wind, solar and hydrogen power and incorporates patented sail management and unique propulsion systems. It aims to reduce CO2 emissions from operations in offshore industries including energy, renewables, ocean sciences, marine environmental protection and military.Other potential markets for Oceandrone include telecoms, subsea data storage, ocean research, fish farming, seabed mineral exploration, carbon capture, hydrogen generation and ocean sciences.Business development director Garry Millard said: “Innovo is committed to developing an autonomous, eco-robotic wind, solar-cell and hydrogen fuel-cell sailing craft that will revolutionise unmanned autonomous surface vehicles.“Innovo's innovation will help the Scottish government reach its goal of net zero carbon by 2045 by replacing marine survey support vessels working within the renewable energy sector and supporting a reduction in travel, thereby reducing CO2 emissions.”He added: “This R&D project with Strathclyde University moves us closer to our objectives of creating 15 Scottish jobs, generating £10 million in annual revenue, spending an additional £3m on R&D and achieving an export value of £20m by 2025.”Strathclyde University’s Power Networks Demonstration Centre (PNDC) is hosting the ETP-funded R&D project for Oceandrone’s development.Brian Cross, project manager at ETP, said: “At our very first meeting with Innovo we knew we were dealing with a highly innovative Scottish SME [small and medium-sized enterprise] that needed some additional technical expertise to take their product forward.“We were able to connect them to Dr Mazheruddin Sayed at the Institute for Energy & Environment, University of Strathclyde, and the project has been a complete success, proving once again, that knowledge exchange between Scotland’s SMEs and our university researchers can be a game-changer in low carbon energy product development,” he added.READ MORE: Flat-pack solar capture device among winners of Scottish Edge net zero pitch at COP26A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this article.

Well, if you're offered a chance to take the first flight to London's sister city after the lifting of a 19-month US travel  ban, you go large, don't you? The morality of taking a transatlantic jet trip in the middle of COP26 bothered me for about a nanosecond before I agreed to it. And I can report that Manhattan remains worth every footsore, red-eyed, hotdog-gorging moment you can spend in her hectic, uncompromising bounds.It was a surprisingly emotional flight. Our Virgin Airbus 350 staged a historic joint take-off with rival British Airways on Monday, bound for a city I first visited in 1982 as part of an exchange programme my south London comp had with a Long Island High School.Since then I've seen New York boisterous and vulgar in the Nineties, subdued after 9/11, and battered by the 2012 Frankenstorm that punctuated the Obama/Romney election (where New Yorkers ""voted"" by sticking chewing gum wads to a picture of their preferred candidate).I last visited in 2018, exploring lesser known neighbourhoods Inwood and the Heights, watching basketball at Madison Square Garden and 93-year-old drummer Roy Haynes at the Blue Note jazz club.Emerging from a pandemic that cost more than 56,000 New Yorkers their lives and saw emergency morgues and mass graves, would the place retain its brash, flash swagger?The answer is, yes and no. The first sign that New York is quieter is that both immigration control and the ride into the city were the fastest I have known. There are fewer tourists around, fewer people on the streets and cars on the road.Each time I arrive here, I ground myself by walking to familiar landmarks: Grand Central Station, the Chrysler Building, the Public Library. This week I went up the Empire State for the first time since I brought my wife here for her first visit in 1997: no queues for those wonderful views.Signs that New York is, conversely, just as excessive as ever can be found a few blocks along 33rd Street from the historic skyscraper, where Manhattan West has been magicked into being on top of the railway lines of Hudson Yards. This $25 billion cluster of architectural totems overlooking the river will be home to Peloton's corporate HQ and a new venture from master restaurateur Danny Meyer (chair of Shake Shack), among much else.Here already is The Edge, a pointy skyscraper with a high-end shopping centre on its lower floors and the aforementioned triangular viewing platform near the top, from which you can see the whole of Manhattan.Truly brave souls can do City Climb, scaling the very tip of the building and leaning out attached to a safety line. I thought about them as I sipped cold champagne in the unseasonably warm November sun on the viewing platform. My hotel, the Pendry Manhattan West, opened just eight weeks ago but already felt like a fixture, its rippled glass façade by SOM architects modest and pleasing compared to its bombastic neighbours. It has two terraces, a spanking new gym, a beautiful tucked away bar and a fourth-floor restaurant with a punchier, ground-floor dining room, Zou Zou's from serial dining entrepreneur Michael Stillman, opening soon.Nearer the Hudson is the first hotel from gym chain Equinox, an elegant pencil of a building opened in 2019. Here I was given a tour of its 24th floor restaurant and outdoor pool, a complementary facial and a cryotherapy treatment (three minutes in my pants in a tank chilled way below freezing) which would have set me back more than 300 bucks.Nearby is the Vessel, Thomas Heatherwick's heart-shaped structure of interlocking staircases. It was closed after a person committed suicide there, the fourth to have done so - a reminder that New York can be brutal as well as brilliant.A sun-dappled walk along the High Line linear park took me to Little Island, a happier Heatherwick vision. This lushly planted open space for performance or reflection replaced a derelict pier: it's supported by concrete ""tulips"" that recall Heatherwick's Olympic cauldron design, and was paid for by $260 million of mogul Barry Diller's money. As with Manhattan West, I marvel at the ability of this island of 22.82 square miles to find and develop new territory and infrastructure. The grim and crowded Penn Station is being expanded beneath the beautiful post office building of Moynihan Hall, necessitating much pedestrian displacement above. ""These f****n' people won't let me get where I'm going,"" shouted a well-dressed man fighting through the pedestrian throng.Strolling through Greenwich and Soho, or up Broadway and Fifth Avenue, you pass empty shops and many restaurants closed by Covid.Others alternately survive or thrive with covered outdoor seating, and rooftops which are at a premium.Among the places I paused at were Gallow Green, the restaurant in the ""faux"" hotel where immersive theatre company Punchdrunk usually perform; the glass-fronted balconied top floor of Hotel Hugo; and Soho's highly agreeable Broome Street bar. The chess players were out in force in Washington Square but someone had designated a ""Screaming Spot"" in chalk on a pathway at Union Square Park. There are Covid testing and booster stations in gazebos on street corners everywhere: and also, to my eyes, even more homeless people than usual.Theatre is back with a vengeance, in all its stratified variety. Over two days I saw the experimental Wooster Group give a typically bracing reading of Brecht's The Mother in the downtown garage they've occupied since 1975; Edie Falco and Blair Brown in British writer Simon Stephens's new play Morning Sun at Manhattan Theatre Club; and a preview of the exuberant musical adaptation of Mrs Doubtfire, eventually destined for London.Everyone wears masks inside, and you are asked for your vaccine passport everywhere.In the last hours before filing this and boarding my overnight return flight, I worked my way down Central Park via the Kandinsky exhibition at the Guggenheim, Surrealism at the Met, and the Automania show dedicated to the car as artwork at the Museum of Modern Art. All sparsely attended, with opening hours limited, and entry pre-booked, but all in their own way wonderful. Like London, New York is nowhere near back to normal, but it's open and ready for rediscovery. What are you waiting for?                     Five reasons to visit NYC now                                        1. The Broadway shows                    Old favourites like Phantom, Chicago and Company are back or about to be, with Hugh Jackman in The Music Man opposite Sutton Foster, fresh from her London triumph in Anything Goes.                     2. The great outdoors                   This built-up metropolis discovered the joys of the outdoors in the pandemic: not just Central Park and Riverside but boat tours to Governors Island and the Circle Line boat tour that takes you around Manhattan.                     3. The food scene                   New Yorkers are raving about south Indian restaurant Semma in the West Village, which is also where you'll find highly rated wine bar Temperance.                     4. Elton John                   Yes, he's playing London, but how amazing would it be to see Elt at Madison Square Garden early next year?                     5. A white Christmas                   Flights may be pricey but there will be deals on accommodation. After nearly two years away, live out those fantasies of a snowy Fifth Avenue and ice skating at Rockefeller Center.

462,Family's plea after NHS worker was killed by bus that ran a red light,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,standard.co.uk,News,487,"NEWS,UK;Version:1",487,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Ross Lydall,,,,Family's plea after NHS worker was killed by bus that ran a red light,"A call was made today for better checks on bus drivers after a NHS  psychotherapist was run over and killed on a pedestrian crossing.Gilla Gelberg was hit by a double-decker in Stratford High Street  after the driver was distracted by an onboard camera screen and ran a red light.A coroner recorded a verdict that she had been unlawfully killed. The inquest last month was told that the driver had a history of drug and alcohol addiction and had been involved in previous collisions. The CPS reversed its decision not to prosecute the driver, who has not been named, after an appeal from Ms Gelberg's husband, Jonathan Wilson. But the driver died before he could be tried for causing death by careless driving.Ms Gelberg, 63, from Crouch End, was the psychodynamic psychotherapy team leader at East London NHS Foundation Trust. She was on a lunch break and had waited for the green man before crossing. She was pronounced dead at the scene in June 2018.The inquest, before Walthamstow assistant coroner Ian Wade QC, heard the driver had received treatment for drug and alcohol abuse since 2013. He had been looking at images from the top deck at the time of the collision, for no apparent reason, the coroner said. Tower Transit, the firm which operated the bus at the time, told the court it would not have employed the driver had they known about his medical history. Mr Wilson said his wife was in her ""dream job"" working with people with complex needs resulting from social deprivation, family abuse and refugee status. Speaking after the inquest, he called on Transport for London to review driver screening procedures used by the capital's private bus operators. He said: ""We're still struggling to come to terms with the brutal shock of the heart of our family being wiped out in an instant. It remains a matter of great concern that a driver with such a medical history could be employed to drive a double-decker bus ... We think it is wrong that individuals with such issues can be put into a demanding life-critical role without adequate screening and monitoring.""Angela Batchelor, from Irwin Mitchell, who represented Ms Gelberg's family, said: ""Gilla's death is a stark reminder of the dangers drivers can potentially pose to other vulnerable road users by not paying attention.""It is understood that the driver passed a pre-employment drugs and alcohol test and also did so after the collision. Louise Cheeseman, TfL's director of bus operations, said: ""Ms Gelberg's death was a tragedy and our thoughts remain with her family and friends.""We will work closely with Tower Transit in relation to any lessons that can be learnt from this horrific incident and respond to any recommendations made by the Traffic Commissioner.""

Building regulations differ dependent on the type of building, but all have residents safety at their core.""The Government said: ""The safety and wellbeing of residents is our priority and the Building Safety Bill will strengthen oversight and protections for everyone in high rise buildings.""All new buildings of any height must meet building regulations fire safety requirements and we have already banned the use of all combustible materials on external walls of new residential buildings over 18 metres.""

Visitors can uncover the story of plastic – its history, science, industry, and impact on our environment. “They will learn the importance of establishing a circular economy and find out how activism and individual action happening now will lead to positive change in the future,” said the Co-operative Innovations, Greenpop and Baz-Art team.Baz-Art co-founder Alexandre Tilmans said: “Throughout history, art has been a powerful medium to communicate a message and change the world. We’re hoping that this experience engages a global audience and shows people that we can change our future if we act now.”Co-operative Innovations project lead Emma Cooper said: “When we demonstrated the project, the one thing everyone mentioned was how much they loved the ability to move around the 3D paintings.”Visit https://baz-art.co.za/highlights/projects/museum-of-plastic/",Copyright 2021 Independent Newspapers Pty (Ltd) All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|CA,CWPRO,CW,CZ|ENGLISH|BRITISH COUNCIL|ARTISTS & PERFORMERSASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONSPOLLUTION & ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTSPAINTINGREPORTS, REVIEWS & SECTIONSVISUAL ARTISTSCLIMATOLOGYSCIENCE POLICYCIRCULAR ECONOMYCLIMATE CHANGEGREEN ECONOMYNEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSNEGATIVE NEWSPLASTIC POLLUTIONPLASTIC WASTENONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONSECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS|MUSEUMS & GALLERIESARTISTS & PERFORMERSPAINTINGVISUAL ARTISTSCIRCULAR ECONOMYGREEN ECONOMYPLASTIC POLLUTIONPLASTIC WASTEPLASTICS REGULATION & POLICYSINGLE USE PLASTICS|CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA|SOUTH AFRICAUNITED KINGDOM",

FABULOUS BINGO: GET A £5 FREE BONUS WITH NO DEPOSIT REQUIREDAnd just to be extra safe, absolutely everything the caterers were holding also had to be signed off.Graham added: ""For higher calibre banquets, we're required to put all our food, containers, knives and kitchen equipment through an X-ray machine whilst motorcycles then drove us into the castle.""Needless to say, day-to-day dining in the royal households is MUCH more casual.In his latest YouTube video , another former royal chef Darren McGrady revealed how he would trick The Queen  into picking Princess Diana 's favourite pudding.He said: ""I always suggested two puddings for the menu - Diana's favourite and one the Queen didn't like so I knew the Queen would pick the Bread and Butter Creme souffle.""It worked every time and the Princess got it whenever she visited the Queen. When the platter came back to the kitchen I had to fight off the chefs from digging in and I'd put it into the warmer and wait.""In an interview with Marie Claire , ex-royal staffer Darren indicated that Her Majesty is quite down-to-earth with how her dishes are served.The chef said: ""People always say, 'oh, the Queen must eat off gold plates with gold knives and forks.'""Yes, sometimes... but at Balmoral she'd eat fruit from a plastic yellow Tupperware container.""In even more Royal Family news, Kate Middleton gave a rare glimpse inside her everyday bag  & it's surprisingly normal.And the Queen's granddaughter set to reject chance to become working royal.

469,FOOTSIE GIANT PULLS PLUG ON CAR BATTERIES,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday (London),News,569,Pg. 82,569,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,BY FRANCESCA WASHTELL,,JOHNSON MATTHEY PLC,JOHNSON MATTHEY PLC,FOOTSIE GIANT PULLS PLUG ON CAR BATTERIES,"BRITAIN'S ambition to become an electric car battery champion suffered a setback yesterday as Johnson Matthey abandoned a pioneering programme.The FTSE?100 chemicals group said it would scrap years of research and development because it was too far behind foreign competitors in China and Korea who are already making batteries on a huge scale.The decision puts a question mark over 400 high-skilled jobs - most of which are in County Durham and Oxfordshire. Johnson Matthey's U-turn came as the company also said it would lose its chief executive of eight years, Robert MacLeod (pictured), and warned profits this year would be lower than some City estimates.The toxic cocktail of bad news sent Johnson Matthey shares into a tailspin.The stock tanked 19.1pc, or 527p, to 2236p, wiping £900m off the company's value.The news came at an awkward time for Boris Johnson, alerting the world to one of Britain's biggest companies admitting defeat in a key area of the race to go green as the Cop26 climate summit entered its final stages.Johnson Matthey makes most of its money from producing catalytic converters to filter exhaust emissions from petrol and diesel cars. Around one in three cars on the road worldwide are thought to have one of the company's converters attached.But looming bans on sales of traditional cars mean Johnson Matthey has been looking for new places to gain a foothold.It began its work on batteries in 2012 and had developed a technology called enhanced lithium nickel oxide, which enables electric cars to run for much longer than they can.Johnson Matthey, which traces its origins back 200 years to the industrial revolution, will now focus more on its work on hydrogen - which is expected to become another major growth area in the coming years.Car industry expert and Birmingham Business School academic David Bailey said: Battery production is all about scale and getting costs down - and Johnson Matthey wasn't able to do that. They've been at it a long time and thought they had a unique technology they could charge a premium for - that was the wrong bet and cost them dearly.'The announcement was a shock for the City after Johnson Matthey earlier this year earmarked £600m to invest in battery and hydrogen technologies, which many saw as a vote of confidence in the business. And six months ago MacLeod announced a decision to expand the electric battery division with a large facility in Finland. There are fears that Johnson Matthey's experience is a sign of more shocks to come for the UK industry.Bailey said: Johnson Matthey's announcement is a blow for the UK automotive industry.The UK is lagging badly behind in terms of putting in place the electric battery production infrastructure needed to really be a serious competitor.'Nissan and its partner Envision recently unveiled plans to expand its giant battery-making gigafactory' in Sunderland as electric car demand has soared. Plans by another group, Britishvolt, to build a factory in the UK is still in the early stages.MacLeod, 57, will step down in February after almost eight years in the job. He will be succeeded by the head of Bayer's crop science unit, Liam Condon.MacLeod has staked much of his and the company's reputation on its electric battery tech.He said that while its products were a success, the group had concluded we will not achieve the return necessary to justify further investment'.© Daily Mail",Copyright 2021 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

The intrepid explorers have set off on an arduous 1,100 mile trip to reach the Pole of Inaccessibility (POI).The POI, which marks the centre of the Antarctic, is the most inhospitable part of the terrain and is the point furthest from any coast.Ex-soldier  Justin Packshaw and partner Jamie Facer-Childs flew by plane from Cape Town, South Africa, to Novo on Tuesday morning.The duo set off on their journey on Friday, which will take them over ice crevasses, through glacier fields and on to the Antarctic ice plateau in freezing -50C conditions.Once the centre of the continent is reached, the pair will set off on the second leg of the trip which will see them ski 560 miles to the South Pole before taking on a final 800-mile stretch to the coast.Team leader Justin Packshaw, 56, from London, who has climbed Everest and is chairman of luxury adventure company Juro Experiences, said: ""I'm super excited - the day before these things are always fraught because there is so much to do. As soon as we arrive in Antarctica, that's it. You don't have access to comms and you have to make sure you have all the right kit. My partner Jamie and I are as ready as we can be.""They will receive no mechanical assistance, relying solely on their own man-power with only kites to aid them.The aim of the expedition is to conduct research in collaboration with organisations including NASA, the European Space Agency and Stanford University.Mr Packshaw added: ""There's two sides to the science - one is on the environment. We'll be looking at radiation levels, UV levels and then general meteorology, so things like temperature and wind speed, ice levels and how the ice is, snow density, which we'll be measuring every day.""The next point is on our physiology and psychology. We're probably up there with the most tested individuals on the planet at the moment - that is done with smart technology that we're wearing which measures our heart rate and stress levels and sleep levels.""We will also take samples of our blood, saliva, pee and poo once a week - we have been doing it for the past five months and will do it for the whole trip and four months after. Once all of that data is crunched it gives a huge amount of interesting stats...so from a scientific point of view the trip is going to be quite awesome.""The pair have been recommended by doctors to stick to a gruelling 8000-calories a day diet.Mr Packshaw says breakfast will consist of cereal or porridge, ""lots of chocolate and nuts and pork scratchings"" for lunch and a freeze-dried meal in the evening, which could be anything from spaghetti bolognaise or chili con carne, and a pudding for dessert. They will also have two protein shakes each day - one in the morning and another in the evening.

479,Fresh Tory sleaze row as Boris Johnson summons Cabinet to find a way out of crisis damaging his party (over wine and canapes) - but one senior minister tells furious backbenchers expenses scandal was 'a billion times worse' amid voter backlash fears,"November 12, 2021 Friday",Non-jurisdictional,MailOnline,News,969,NEWS;Version:1,969,,"David Wilcock, Whitehall Correspondent For MailonlineJason Groves, Political Editor For The Daily Mail",,,,Fresh Tory sleaze row as Boris Johnson summons Cabinet to find a way out of crisis damaging his party (over wine and canapes) - but one senior minister tells furious backbenchers expenses scandal was 'a billion times worse' amid voter backlash fears,"•PM held a five-hour summit over wine and canapes at No10 last night•Followed days of negative headlines about MPs lining their own pockets•Nadine Dorries told junior minister he was over-playing voter backlash fears•Culture Secretary told him: 'The expenses scandal was a billion times worse'                     Boris Johnson summoned his Cabinet to Downing Street to find a way out of the sleaze mire engulfing the Conservative Party - as one of his most senior ministers played down the severity of the crisis.The Prime Minister held a five-hour summit over wine and canapes at No10 last night to thrash out a plan of action after days of negative headlines about MPs lining their own pockets while serving in Parliament. It's understood the meeting focused on his levelling up agenda, with ministers arriving carrying maps.But the same evening Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries told a Tory junior minister he was over-reacting when he voiced concerns of a voter backlash.In a WhatsApp message obtained by the Times she told George Freeman: 'The expenses scandal, which began the day of the European elections in 2009 and ended on the day of the ballot, was a billion times worse than last week.'The duck house was a Conservative. Every single MP was in the media. Half a dozen MPs were banged into prison. Many had to pay huge sums of money back in expenses claimed. We dominated ... the front page of every single newspaper and news bulletin for five whole weeks. 'One year later, almost to the day, we monstered Labour in the local elections and David Cameron became PM breaking 13 years of Labour domination.'Last week wasn't great, but it was a long way from the worst.' In his first intervention on the crisis, Rishi Sunak last night hinted at Cabinet divisions over the Prime Minister's disastrous attempt to block the suspension of former minister Owen Paterson for breaking lobbying rules.During a round of media interviews yesterday, Mr Sunak said: 'Reflecting over recent events - I think for us as a Government, it's fair to say that we need to do better than we did last week, and we know that.' Meanwhile, the Cabinet meeting was ostensibly focusing on the Levelling Up agenda with ministers due to lay out how their department is contributing to the drive. Originally the team had planned an away-day at Chequers, but plans for this were dropped and they met at Downing Street instead.Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey arrived armed with an A3 map seemingly to help get her message across.However, the political discussion is believed to have also addressed how to quell the rising tide of criticism about second jobs, conflicting interests and cronyism among MPs.Health Secretary Sajid Javid, Housing Secretary Michael Gove and Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke were among those seen departing Downing Street after gathering for crunch talks late into the night.Allies of the Chancellor say he was dismayed by the decision last week to order Tory MPs to vote to tear up Parliament's anti-sleaze laws in order to save Mr Paterson.The Prime Minister won the vote after imposing a three-line whip. Mr Sunak was absent for the vote because he was at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow at the time.But the plan was abandoned the following day in the face of a huge public outcry, prompting Mr Paterson to resign as an MP.The episode has triggered a wave of sleaze allegations against the Conservatives and seen the outside interests of all MPs come under fresh scrutiny.It has also resulted in a Tory slump in the polls, with Labour taking the lead for the first time in a year in several surveys.Mr Sunak did not comment directly on the cases of either Mr Paterson or Sir Geoffrey Cox, the former attorney general who has racked up more than £5.5million in outside earnings.He said: 'People will have different motivations for doing what they do, the pay is set by an independent body, that's absolutely right.'And with regard to second jobs, there's an independent process that we have that's set by Parliament that governs all of those things. And it's absolutely right that that process is followed to the letter.'Cabinet Office minister Steve Barclay expressed 'regret' this week for the 'mistake' made in attempting to force through a change in the rules on the back of Mr Paterson's case.As condemnation grew, the PM moved to remind MPs that they should 'devote yourself primarily and above all to your constituents'. But he proposed no new measures to restore public confidence. And he has so far refused to offer any apology for opening up a damaging line of attack for Labour.An ally of Mr Sunak said he viewed last week's events as 'a mistake' and believed 'that point needs to be made by someone in the Cabinet'.No 10 sources played down suggestions of Cabinet divisions, saying: 'The PM has said that it is vital MPs focus on their constituents and obey the rules. He thinks those who break the rules should be punished. We are all agreed on this.'But another Cabinet source said the PM had 'f***ed up' and that the attempt to block the suspension of Mr Paterson looked 'totally crooked'. Business minister Paul Scully hinted at anger over the damage caused by the sleaze row yesterday.Questioned about the conduct of Sir Geoffrey, he told Sky News: 'I'm not going to defend Geoffrey. I'm not going to say anything.'Backbench Tories also voiced anger at the events of the last week, which have left many of them facing a backlash from constituents.One former minister told the Daily Mail: 'The last week has been a hideous nightmare - it is dirtying us all. When we made him PM we knew there would be periods of chaos but that was a price worth paying to defeat Corbyn and get Brexit done.'Those two tasks are completed now and his situation is more perilous than people think.'

The excuse that climate change is expected to cause increased stormy weather at unusual times of the year when leaves are still on the tree should not be used as a reason for human activity to fell mature trees.""However following a meeting with SPEN planners, Mr Kaye is confident that the issue of mature tree felling is high on their agenda.But he said: ""I still urge vigilance and local community awareness to potentially prevent further unnecessary felling.""An SP Energy Networks spokesperson said: ""We are currently working to rebuild and refurbish an 11kV overhead line from Penpont to Closeburn.""As part of this work, and as with any work we undertake, we aim to minimise the impact on the natural environment, including the felling of trees, often looking for alternative routes where possible.""However, there are occasions where we must clear certain areas to ensure the network is as resilient and reliable as possible.""Any trees that have been identified to be cleared or crowned as part of this process have been agreed to in advance with the respective landowners.""We have met with Mr Kaye to discuss his concerns and explained in detail the works we have planned.""",Copyright 2021 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|DGS|ENGLISH|National Edition|CLIMATE CHANGETALKS & MEETINGSHEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENTNEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSLAND USE & DEVELOPMENTLAND USE PLANNINGELECTRIC MOBILITYPRIME MINISTERSELECTRIC VEHICLES|ELECTRIC POWER PLANTSELECTRICITY TRANSMISSION & DISTRIBUTIONENERGY & UTILITIESLOGGING INDUSTRYNATURAL GAS & ELECTRIC UTILITIESLAND USE PLANNINGELECTRIC MOBILITYELECTRIC VEHICLES|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|SCOTLAND",
481,Gautam Adani's $70 billion pledge now includes greenest data centres,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Business Line,News,918,,918,"India, Republic of",,,ADANI ENTERPRISES LTD,ADANI ENTERPRISES LTDRELIANCE INDUSTRIES LTDGOOGLE LLCAMAZON.COM INC,Gautam Adani's $70 billion pledge now includes greenest data centres,"  The conglomerate has committed to invest a total $70 billion by 2030 across its green energy value chain to become the world's largest renewable energy producer  Billionaire Gautam Adani wants his conglomerate to be a world leader in green data storage, with data centres run entirely on clean power playing a key part in his ambition to recast an empire built largely on coal mining and trading into a renewable energy giant. ""It is inevitable that massive data centre infrastructure will become the largest energy-consuming industry to ever exist,"" Adani, chairman of Adani Group and Asia's second-richest person, said at the Bloomberg India Economic Forum on Thursday. As India exponentially expands its clean energy capacity at one of the lowest costs, it ""will make us the greenest choice to warehouse not just India's but perhaps much of the world's data.""  The conglomerate has committed to invest a total $70 billion by 2030 across its green energy value chain to become the world's largest renewable energy producer. It is one of the two biggest tailwinds behind Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who made a surprise pledge at COP26 for India to touch net-zero carbon emissions by 2070. Reliance Industries Ltd., helmed by Asia's richest man Mukesh Ambani, plans to spend $10 billion on renewables over the next three years. Adani will face multiple challenges in powering data centres as they require 24X7 power supply, according to Shantanu Jaiswal, BloombergNEF's head of India research. ""Adani must invest in storage of renewable energy or find other sources to ensure uninterrupted power supply when the sun isn't shining or the wind breeze is weak,"" Jaiswal said. Notwithstanding the hurdles, the 59-year-old billionaire sees a booming demand for data centres as ultra-speedy 5G services, quantum computing and cloud storage applications expand. Digital transactions also got a massive boost during the Covid-19 pandemic that forced people to work, study and shop from home. India is becoming a hot market for providing data storage services to global firms such as Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google amid rapid surge in smartphone usage and cheap mobile data tariffs. 'Hard to replicate' ""The Adani Group is well positioned to benefit from this trend given our ability to build data centres, connect data centres, and provide 100% green power to data centres - a provision that will be hard to replicate at an economic scale elsewhere in the world,"" the tycoon said. The Adani conglomerate is rapidly ramping up its solar energy portfolio and its ports business aims to be carbon neutral by 2025. Adani firms have raised almost $1.1 billion in green and sustainability-linked dollar bonds in 2021, and another $1.35 billion in offshore loans -- making them the biggest issuers of ESG debt from India, data compiled by Bloomberg show. ""We are doing all we can to make renewables a viable, affordable alternative to fossil fuels,"" said Adani, a first-generation entrepreneur who started off as a diamond trader in Mumbai in the 1980s, then helped run his brother's plastics business in Gujarat before setting up Adani Enterprises Ltd. -- the group's flagship company -- as an agri-commodities trader in 1988. Runaway rally Adani Enterprises rose as much as 2.1% in Mumbai on Friday, pushing this year's runaway rally to more than 250%. Adani Green Energy Ltd. advanced as much as 2.9%, taking its climb to almost 20% in 2021. In the past two decades, the group has rapidly diversified into ports, power generation and distribution, airports, data centres and digital services. The tycoon has added $52 billion to his net worth this year -- one of the biggest gainers in 2021 -- pushing his wealth to almost $86 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Also read: Adani looks to be a 'partner of choice' for global businesses eyeing green infrastructure Adani's sustainability claims, however, are criticized by climate campaigners who point to the group's Carmichael coal mining project in Australia, which will expand supplies of the highly-polluting fossil fuel. The Adani Group opted to self-fund after having trouble in securing external funding and is targeting the first shipment by the end of this year. 'Miracle fuel' Adani also spoke about his group being well positioned to produce the world's cheapest green hydrogen, calling it ""a miracle fuel and a miracle feedstock"" which can disrupt many industries such as the chemicals and metals sectors. Ambani's Reliance too is aiming for green hydrogen at $1 per kilogram by the turn of this decade -- a price that could threaten fossil fuels. ""Indian billionaires understand the importance of green hydrogen for deep decarbonization of the economy,"" said Rohit Gadre, an analyst at BloombergNEF, adding that Adani will face intense competition from home-grown as well as global rivals in its pursuit of pole position as the world's top renewable power producer. The Adani group has been adding muscle to its renewable portfolio.

482,Girls displaced and hurt by climate crisis,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Kingston Whig-Standard,News,1346,OPINION;Pg. A4,1346,Ontario,Geoffrey JohnstonKingston Whig-Standard,,INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR MIGRATION,INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR MIGRATION,Girls displaced and hurt by climate crisis,"First in a series about children displaced by climate change. While media coverage of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) tended to focus on speeches by world leaders and other notable figures, the plight of children displaced by climate shocks received scant attention.""The last three reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) make extensive and alarming references to the impacts of climate change on migration,"" the website of the International Organization for Migration notes.""The reports show that land degradation is already negatively impacting the livelihoods and well-being of at least 3.2 billion people, while sea level rise, associated with a 2 C warmer world, could submerge the homelands of 280 million people by the end of this century across the world - this could be reduced in a 1.5 C scenario."" UN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS In 2015, the world came together at the United Nations to endorse the Sustainable Development Goals, a set of human development benchmarks that stress equality, equity, health and environmentalism. Under Sustainable Development Goal 5, the community of nations is committed to achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls by 2030. However, the climate migration crisis is putting the SDGs in jeopardy.Is the climate crisis slowing progress regarding SDG 5? ""This is a really important question,"" Stu Solomon, Plan International Canada's senior adviser on economic empowerment and resilience, replied. ""The reality is that climate change is already exacerbating gender inequalities.""Plan International is a humanitarian non-governmental organization that conducts international development work in 75 countries. According to the NGO's website, Plan International is ""dedicated to advancing children's rights and equality for girls.""Women and girls already face many barriers in life, including entrenched gender norms as well as limited education and economic opportunities, Solomon explained. ""We have evidence from our research showing that climate change is undoing many of the development gains made over the last 15 or 20 years in the Millennium Development Goals and the SDGs.""Girls tend to be the first ones to be pulled out of school when climate disasters strike, he continued. And the excessive heat generated by climate change ""forces women and girls to farm on evermore degraded and marginalized land, which reduces both their economic opportunity but also forces them to move to areas maybe outside of their community.""Traditionally, in many parts of the world, girls tend to be responsible for collecting biomass for fuel and water for drinking. Due to increasingly scarce natural resources in the age of climate change, ""they are being forced to walk farther and farther,"" which limits their opportunities to go to school and ""enjoy childhood,"" Solomon said. ""It puts them at risk of gender-based violence, sexual violence, because they are away from the household for longer on their own."" NEGATIVE COPING MECHANISM ""We have also seen that communities that have been repeatedly hit by climate disasters engage in negative coping mechanisms,"" Solomon revealed. For example, a girl might be married off so that the family has one less mouth to feed or as a source of dowry income.According to a new UNICEF report, ""Children uprooted in a changing climate,"" 850 million children ""are exposed to four or more climate stresses."" In addition, the report states that ""existing evidence suggests young people are the most likely to move in response to climate-related shocks.""What are the risks and benefits of migration as a strategy to adapt to climate change? ""There are opportunities if communities are supported to transition to new areas,"" Solomon answered. ""There is displacement that is already happening due to climate change. And that is going to continue over the next 30 to 50 years.""During climate migration, it is important to ensure that the rights of girls ""are upheld and that systems are in place to protect girls and young people,"" the Plan International staffer stated. For example, when communities migrate, there need to be consultations regarding land ownership, the availability of productive agricultural land, and skills development for migrants, including girls.""What we have seen with migration is that families don't always migrate together,"" Solomon said. For instance, a male member of the household may migrate first to earn money and establish a presence in a new community.""That leaves behind a single head of a household and girls who are significantly at risk during that period to sexual violence, to early marriage,"" Solomon explained. And during that time, they may not be able to afford education fees.""We know that this displacement causes school dropout,"" he added. Education gives girls the opportunity to earn a livelihood and to build leadership skills, so they can ""advocate for their own wants and needs, which is really important."" FRAGILE STATES How is the climate crisis exacerbating existing threats that girls face in fragile states or conflict zones? ""There is overlap between geographies that are facing climate threats and conflict. We see this in parts of Nigeria, in parts of West Africa, even in Ethiopia,"" Solomon replied. When people are forced to migrate, girls may be forced into child labour.""This double-edged sword of climate and conflict is really placing large portions of the most vulnerable, those who are already risk, in evermore dire situations.""What can the community of nations do to help girls and their communities in low-and middle-income countries become more resilient in the face of the climate crisis? ""That's a great question,"" Solomon responded. ""This is where the rubber really hits the road.""Under the terms of the Paris Climate Agreement, the world's wealthy nations agreed to collectively underwrite climate change adaptation and mitigation in developing countries. However, wealthy nations have so far failed to meet their promise to provide $100 billion per year through 2025.""That target, despite that fact that it is more than five years old, has now been moved farther ahead,"" Solomon said. Moreover, he said the money that has been spent on climate change is mostly going to mitigation rather than adaptation.This means that the needs of girls are not being supported. Plan International and other humanitarian organizations ""are calling for a significant increase in financing to not just the electrification and transition from oil to solar, but also to support systems and households to become more resilient,"" Solomon said.For example, schools built in areas that are prone to disasters and extreme weather need assistance in managing climate risks. In addition, Solomon said there must be greater support for education when disaster strikes.""We also need to make sure that climate financing goes to places that need it most,"" Solomon said of the world's most vulnerable countries.Finally, working with and funding women's rights groups, youth-led organizations and other local organizations should be a priority, because they ""understand how the climate emergency is impacting communities on a day-to-day basis,"" Solomon asserted. AGENTS OF CHANGE Young people are climate activists. Are they also agents of change? ""Absolutely,"" Solomon replied. Youth have really kept the climate emergency on the ""front burner,"" he continued. ""It's not just the 'Gretas'(Greta Thunberg) and the big names that we see who have done incredible work, but there are local young people taking action every day in their communities.""Climate change is an intergenerational issue. And it is an intergenerational crisis because the world we are leaving behind is their world. ... They are going to be the ones living in this warmer world. While they may not be climate scientists, they do know what's important, and they are able to take action."" Follow Geoffrey P.

The area will be created by 2026.Aitken said the council had taken some ""tough decisions"" around pollution and congestion including Scotland's first low emissions zone and wanted to take this a step further.Aitken, a SNP councillor, added: ""We are going to announce that we have designated a core of our historic city centre from George Square, over to Hope Street where Central Station is, from Cathedral Street to the north to Argyle Street to the south and work towards that being a space entirely free of private cars over the next five years - with caveats for disabled access.""This core of Glasgow city centre will be given over entirely to public transport and to people moving actively.""It's a big step and we don't underestimate the challenge of making that transition from what has been for far too long a private-car dominated city centre. It is something that will have to be delivered in partnership with city centre businesses, which is why we will do it incrementally over the next five years or so. But I think it's the kind of ambition that we have to demonstrate. We have to move beyond doing this partially and do it on a bigger sale.""We need new ideas, a new vision and collaborations to create that better and sustainable life that we envision for everyone in Glasgow.""The announcement was made yesterday at an event to promote the role of cities in tackling the climate crisis.The council rolled out a project called Spaces for People during the pandemic, which aimed to prioritise pedestrians and cyclists over cars in large areas of Glasgow.Aitken added: ""We've already taken some tough decisions around pollution and congestion including Scotland's first low emissions zone, which will remove all but the greenest vehicles by 2023.""Our Spaces for People project was a major response to Covid as the city reopened after lockdown to reprioritise public space and give it to people rather than cars.""Cop26 reports, pages 20-21",Copyright 2021 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|TIM|ENGLISH|Scotland|CITY LIFEEMISSIONSPUBLIC OFFICIALSNEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSGREENHOUSE GASESPOLLUTION & ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTSHISTORIC DISTRICTS & STRUCTURESSCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTYCLIMATE CHANGEALLIANCES & PARTNERSHIPSCOVID CORONAVIRUSDISABLED ACCESS|EMISSIONSHISTORIC DISTRICTS & STRUCTURESDISABLED ACCESS|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|SCOTLAND",

The 46-year-old presenter had a cameo in several Harry Potter films as a moustached wizard with shoulder-length chestnut locks. Weather presenter Laura Tobin had appeared at the famous Diagon Alley at the Harry Potter studios today as she mentioned Ben's appearance in the magical films. ""I rarely talk about it, as you know Laura, but I had a part,"" Ben joked. ""But the exciting thing was that I thought it would be a good thing to have a moustache. It really wasn't -it's the most irritating thing in the world.""""We had the whole debate, didn't we, about the beard on air,"" Kate pointed out. ""I'm so glad you [froze] that moment because I've watched that movie so many times to try and see him in it and I'm still not convinced you were! ""You look handsome like that, though! With the long hair!Ben said: ""A young Sirius Black, I look like! ""But interestingly, Laura, if you've had a part, the crew in any of the films -and I was lucky to do a number of them -you've got a wand in Ollivanders, which is behind you. You actually have a wand in the wand shop! Have you found mine""She promised: ""So we are allowed to go in but I'm not allowed to touch the wands, so I will go and find it!""It comes amid a chaotic morning for Kate after Red-faced Kate Garraway 'so embarrassed' after phone alarm goes off twice live on GMB, leaving her deeply embarrassed.As they began discussing the COP26 summit, an alarm began to go off as Ben paused speaking and raised his eyebrows.""That's Kate's phone,"" he said pointedly.Kate gasped as she searched under the papers on the desk: ""It can't be! It's not my phone, is it""But Ben told her: ""You're probably sitting on it.""""Am I"" Kate shifted around in her seat and realised it was there. ""That's really awkward.""Ben joked: ""Is that your alarm to wake up""                     Good Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV                   ",Copyright 2021 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved,,Newspaper; Web Publication|WEBDMI|ENGLISH|TELEVISION INDUSTRY,

491,Hard truths over road plans for the future,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Plymouth Herald,News,300,NEWS;Pg. 14,300,England & Wales,,,,,Hard truths over road plans for the future,"SOME will be asking why, when the eyes of the world are on the Cop26 summit in Glasgow in a last-gasp effort to halt climate change, Plymouth City Council is approving multi-millionpound changes to a road junction so that traffic can flow more smoothly.That is a reasonable question and based on reasonable expectations that the last thing we should be doing is encouraging greater numbers of private vehicle journeys.Some would say that we would be better off investing in a forward-thinking tram system to take people out of their cars instead of improving roads, or creating better routes for cyclists who create no emissions at all.Yet the reality is that there is no appetite from politicians to push for a restriction of travel by private vehicle, and that we are far more likely to see a transition towards electric cars - or an avoidance of travel altogether - than we are an abolition of cars in any form.Instead, it is far more likely that we will continue to see cars on the road, just powered by another form. And the work on the stretch of the A386 is being considered as a saving in carbon emissions as it will prevent the stop-start traffic jams that produce more fumes than a free-flowing road.That might feel like a cop-out to those who feel we need more far-reaching change in order to avoid the worst effects of climate change, but sadly, we are unlikely to get the kind of political alliance which could bring about such a change, at least in the foreseeable future.The junction is considered key if the city is to unlock land at the edge of Woolwell for more housing and development, and has been a pinch-point for traffic for many years, so most will welcome it.As to cutting emissions, it will likely come down to our choice of vehicle, rather than the surface we are driving on.",Copyright 2021 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|PLH|ENGLISH|National Edition|CLIMATE CHANGEEMISSIONSLEGISLATIVE BODIESCITIESCITY GOVERNMENTELECTRIC VEHICLE INDUSTRYGREENHOUSE GASESELECTRIC MOBILITYELECTRIC VEHICLESSUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION|VEHICLE TRAFFICEMISSIONSMOTOR VEHICLESELECTRIC VEHICLE INDUSTRYELECTRIC MOBILITYELECTRIC VEHICLESSUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND",

That made Rivian the second most valuable US carmaker after Tesla, which is worth $US1.06 trillion.Despite having only recently started selling vehicles and having little revenue to report, Rivian ranked ahead of General Motors ($US86.05b), Ford ($US77.37b), and Lucid Group ($US65.96b).Since last year, EV companies have emerged as some of the hottest investments. Including securities such as options and restricted stock units, Rivian's fully diluted valuation exceeded $US106b at its debut price.The IPO allowed Rivian to raise about $US12b to fund growth, and that figure could rise to $US13.7b if the full over-allotment of shares is exercised.This makes it the biggest US IPO since Alibaba went public in September 2014.""The transition to a public company (and) the growth in our capital base"" enables Rivian to develop ""promising products and volume and growth in terms of new segments and new vehicles that we'll be going into"", Rivian chief executive R. J. Scaringe, pictured, said.Wall Street's biggest institutional investors, including T. Rowe Price and BlackRock, are betting on Rivian to be the next big player in a sector dominated by Tesla amid mounting pressure on car firms to eliminate vehicle emissions.Amazon is Rivian's biggest shareholder with a 20 per cent share.Rivian's IPO comes against the backdrop of the United Nations COP26 climate talks, where carmakers, airlines and governments unveiled a raft of pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions from global transport.California-based Rivian plans to build at least one million vehicles a year by the end of the decade, Mr Scaringe said. It has announced plans to open a second US factory and eventually set up production in China and Europe.""Rivian is in the early stages of delivering its first vehicles to customers, which tells investors the company and vehicles are 'real' and not merely pictures in a slide deck,"" D. A. Davidson & Co analyst Michael Shlisky said.""This has been an issue with other EV companies in recent months.""Rivian, also backed by Ford, priced an upsized IPO of 153 million shares at $US78 per share, raising nearly $US12b, making it one of the biggest US IPOs of all time.Ford declined to reveal plans for its Rivian stake of about 12 per cent, which was worth about $US10b on Wednesday.",Copyright 2021 West Australian NewsPapers Limited All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|FORD MOTOR COD A DAVIDSON & COGENERAL MOTORS CO|NAICS336112 LIGHT TRUCK & UTILITY VEHICLE MANUFACTURINGNAICS336111 AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURINGSIC3711 MOTOR VEHICLES & PASSENGER CAR BODIESNAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING & SECURITIES DEALINGSIC6211 SECURITY BROKERS, DEALERS, & FLOTATION COMPANIESSIC3714 MOTOR VEHICLE PARTS & ACCESSORIES|FORDP (PAR)F (NYSE)GM (NYSE)|ELECTRIC VEHICLE INDUSTRYELECTRIC VEHICLESINITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGSSTOCK EXCHANGESSTOCK OFFERINGSNEW ISSUESVEHICLE EMISSIONSSECURITIES & OTHER INVESTMENTSSHAREHOLDERSSTOCK PRICESCOMPANY ACTIVITIES & MANAGEMENTPUBLIC COMPANIESEMISSIONSGREENHOUSE GASESEXECUTIVESUNITED NATIONS|ELECTRIC VEHICLE INDUSTRYAUTOMAKERSELECTRIC VEHICLESINITIAL PUBLIC OFFERINGSSTOCK EXCHANGESSTOCK OFFERINGSAUTOMOBILE MFGAUTOMOTIVE MFGNEW ISSUESVEHICLE EMISSIONSSECURITIES & OTHER INVESTMENTSSTOCK PRICESMOTOR VEHICLESEMISSIONS|WESTERN AUSTRALIA, AUSTRALIACALIFORNIA, USA|AUSTRALIACHINAEUROPE",FORDP (PAR)

Major car manufacturers have already committed to going all-electric, and this latest announcement from Hertz is an enormous endorsement for EV adoption across the globe.""This is especially timely in the lead up to COP26 in Glasgow and the federal government's new plan to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.""Several countries have already created their own targets to eliminate petrol-powered cars, and we hope that Australia will soon follow suit.""The decisions made by governments to help or hinder EV adoption in this country will have global consequences, and as global demand for electric vehicles outstrips supply, Australia will be relegated to the bottom of the list.""We are slowly moving down the electric car path, but need to get out of first gear.The order for the Tesla3 models, are at this time only headed to Hertz in the US and Europe.""Hopefully Australia won't be far behind.Motoring news locally every Saturday at 5am on 101.5 Great Lakes FM and 10am on 106.5 Rhema FM.

496,How can Britain cut emissions when the Tory party fetishises travel?,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Guardian (London),News,966,OPINION;Version:1,966,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Andy Beckett,,,,How can Britain cut emissions when the Tory party fetishises travel?,"Travel is often a form of privilege. It needs time and money, and sometimes a confidence that you are welcome somewhere else. During a pandemic and a climate crisis, with travel clearly playing a central role in both, to regularly move across large distances requires an ever stronger sense of entitlement. Yet the great benefits of travel - social, cultural, economic, psychological - have not gone away. And nor has the power of the travel lobby. When flights to the US  resumed for Britons this week, after a long Covid hiatus, much of the media coverage read like an airline press release. There were only occasional hints that today's transatlantic jets do not fit well with the goals of Cop26. Weighing up the costs and benefits of travel would be difficult for any British government. This is a sometimes claustrophobic country with a limited climate and a range of alluringly different places a short flight away. For half a century, foreign holidays have been a hugely valued mass pleasure: Britons fly more than people  in many comparable European countries. And for centuries trade, immigration, emigration, colonisation and the afterlife of empire have made Britain a travel-driven society. Going constantly back and forth from these small islands is what many Britons have always done. With his fondness for private jets  and dislike of delivering bad news, Boris Johnson does not feel like a prime minister suited to bringing our travel habit under control. In fact he is still hoping it won't need to be. In the foreword  to his government's latest plan for reducing carbon emissions, he wrote: ""In 2050, we will still be driving cars, flying planes ... but our cars will be electric [and] our planes will be zero emission, allowing us to fly guilt-free."" From its enthusiasm for roadbuilding  to its refusal to raise fuel duty , from its tax cut  for domestic air passengers to its reluctance to close our borders during the pandemic, Johnson leads a government that seems to fetishise mobility. ""Global Britain"", the "" tilt to the Indo-Pacific  "" in defence policy and the Aukus alliance with the US and Australia all suggest a country frantically seeking more connections with distant places - while neglecting or actively undermining its connections with its European neighbours. Brexit is not a climate-friendly strategy. For all their patriotic rhetoric, today's Tories - such as Sir Geoffrey Cox, with his winter preference for the Caribbean over his Devon constituency - often act as if they can't wait to get out of Britain. Such restlessness has always been a feature of Conservatism. Landowners moving between the country and the city; imperialists sailing away to seize and govern; business executives accumulating air miles; wealthy southerners with second homes abroad; working-class retirees to warmer countries. The party has energetically represented them all. At the same time, the Conservatives have talked a lot about the importance of rootedness, of home-town loyalties, and of protecting Britain against foreign incomers and influences. The party has regularly attacked its opponents as rootless - ""citizens of nowhere""  - with the aid of newspapers owned by globetrotting press lords. The hypocrisy of it all can be maddening, not least because the left has always contained many people strongly attached to their communities, through activism or socioeconomic circumstances. Many Labour supporters, concentrated in the same urban constituencies for decades, aren't ""citizens of nowhere"", but the exact opposite. Yet it's important to remember that Conservatism's double standards can be what makes it appealing to people. As with other freedoms the Tories claim to champion, the party doesn't really believe freedom of movement should be available to all, as the government's approach  to asylum seekers and migrants makes ever more obvious. Consciously or not, even some non-Tories agree with the government on this. If you believe that this country is too crowded, wanting to get away from it regularly while also wanting the state to stop outsiders getting in can seem a necessary contradiction. Conservative voters appear particularly resistant to cutting back on travel. According to the pollsters Ipsos Mori , they are significantly less likely  than Labour supporters to favour a tax on frequent flyers. But there is a chance that this could change. An estimated 15%  of the population take 70% of the UK's flights. Even if all these frequent flyers are Tories - which they are not - that is a much smaller proportion of the population than the party's total vote.So it follows that many Conservatives aren't big travellers. Among less wealthy Tories and more environmentally conscious ones, there may be many people who feel - or who will come to feel, as the climate crisis worsens - that protecting the restless lifestyles of the richest Britons should be less of a government priority. It remains hard, though, to envisage a party that so reveres consumer choice seriously restricting flying, let alone driving. Not having to think about the wider consequences of our consumer decisions is one of the seductive prospects that modern Conservatism has always offered. It's a bit easier to imagine a Labour government, led by Keir Starmer or some other stern figure, telling us that unlimited travel is no longer justifiable - at least until technology makes zero-emission journeys possible. But even with the Tories having a terrible autumn, such a government, like zero-emission jets , still seems a long way off. If we want to be less toxic travellers, for the foreseeable future it's up to us.

497,"How we can lead climate battle in SW;By chairman of the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Local Enterprise Partnership, Mark Duddridge","November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Western Mail,News,690,NEWS;Pg. 17,690,England & Wales,Mark Duddridge,,SEA LTD,SEA LTD,"How we can lead climate battle in SWBy chairman of the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Local Enterprise Partnership, Mark Duddridge","DECARBONISING our economy is both an environmental imperative and a huge opportunity for Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly.The move away from fossil fuels requires massive investment in new global industries, from floating offshore wind to electric vehicles and battery storage. With that investment will come hundreds of thousands of skilled, well paid jobs in the UK economy.For Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, the scale of opportunity in the race to net zero cannot be overstated. Our location at the tip of South West of the UK and our geology gives us an abundance of resources to power the 'green industrial revolution', underpinned by generations of innovation and enterprise. In fact there are few regions where so many investment opportunities come together in one place: Technology metals We have world-class deposits of technology metals like lithium, tin and copper that are essential components in many of today's rapidly growing clean energy technologies, from wind turbines to electric cars.Demand for lithium could grow by 500% by 2050 because of its use in batteries, but the UK is totally reliant on imports. Cornwall sits on top of one of just five lithium-enriched bodies of granite in the world. The UK Government's security and defence review highlights domestic extraction and processing of this 'critical mineral' as a priority.Several companies are currently prospecting for lithium in Cornwall, confident they can extract batterygrade lithium compounds from granite and the geothermal brines deep underground in a low carbon, sustainable way. And it's why we are funding a lithium extraction pilot plant with investment from the Government's Getting Building Fund.Floating offshore wind The seas off Cornwall boast one of the best wind climates in Europe and our region is the birthplace of commercial wind generation in the UK.The Government sees offshore wind as key to decarbonising energy supply and wants to see 40GW of installed capacity by 2030, including 1GW of floating offshore wind. We've been developing our floating wind ambitions in Cornwall for several years because of our proximity to the Celtic Sea and highly experienced offshore renewable energy supply chain.The Celtic Sea one of only two places in the UK singled out by the Government's Net Zero Strategy for large scale floating offshore wind deployment. Some 300MW of projects are already moving forward, with a 30-40MW demonstrator expected to be on site by 2025. Our target of 3GW of installed capacity could support more than 11,000 jobs and generate £900m of net additional GVA. Space and data Significant investment inCornwall's space economy is creating unique assets that will be critical to delivering the Government's National Space Strategy.This includes the launch of the first ever satellite from the UK in 2022 from Spaceport Cornwall at Newquay Cornwall Airport. More than half of the critical measurements on climate change rely on satellite data, and Cornwall will give the UK its own launch capability.And through the recent upgrading of Goonhilly Earth Station there is capacity to track and control spacecraft, take measurements and analyse data as part of a global industry that could be worth £490 billion by 2030.Both these assets have benefited from more than £10m of investment we have secured through the Government's Local Growth Fund and Getting Building Fund.Pioneering Cornwall is tackling climate change in other ways too. We are pioneering commercial deep geothermal energy on two pilot sites, with many more to follow. Our agriculture sector is developing energy rich, renewable biofuels. And our communities are working with industry to trial local energy networks and electric car share schemes.In all these areas the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Local Enterprise Partnership has championed our region as a pioneer of a cleaner, greener future that creates quality jobs and gives us a globally competitive edge.World leaders at COP26 have seen that they must go further and faster to meet the climate emergency head on. We've accepted that challenge and are ready to lead the UK's green industrial revolution.",Copyright 2021 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved,,Newspaper|WMN|ENGLISH|SEA LTD|NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING & BROADCASTING & WEB SEARCH PORTALS|SE (NYSE)|National Edition|OFFSHORE WIND ENERGYRENEWABLE MARINE ENERGYWIND ENERGY INDUSTRYCARBON NEUTRAL ENERGYENERGY & ENVIRONMENTELECTRICITY GENERATING CAPACITYWIND POWER PLANTSENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGYENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRYGEOLOGY & GEOPHYSICSGREEN ECONOMYRENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRYSUSTAINABILITYSUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATIONELECTRIC MOBILITYELECTRIC VEHICLESOFFSHORE ENERGYNATIONAL SECURITYECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORSSUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT|BATTERIESENERGY & UTILITIESOFFSHORE WIND ENERGYRENEWABLE MARINE ENERGYWIND ENERGY INDUSTRYALTERNATIVE & RENEWABLE ENERGYCARBON NEUTRAL ENERGYENERGY & ENVIRONMENTWIND ENERGYELECTRICITY GENERATING CAPACITYWIND POWER PLANTSENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRYGREEN ECONOMYRENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRYSUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATIONELECTRIC MOBILITYELECTRIC VEHICLESOFFSHORE ENERGYSPACE SECTOR PERFORMANCEMOTOR VEHICLES|UNITED KINGDOMEUROPE,SE (NYSE)
498,"HS2: Abandon Leeds, Sheffield and Yorkshire at your peril, Prime Minister – The Yorkshire Post says","November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Yorkshire Post,News,846,COLUMNISTS,846,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,YP Comment,,,,"HS2: Abandon Leeds, Sheffield and Yorkshire at your peril, Prime Minister – The Yorkshire Post says","They view the threat to the area’s economy – and future – so seriously if the Government reneges on its past commitments to the North that the two cities have put decades of rivalry behind them in this public collaboration.Never before have they spoken out like this in a message of unity that The Yorkshire Post endorses ahead of the long-overdue Integrated Rail Plan that will determine the future of HS2 and, in turn, Northern Powerhouse Rail.Don’t abandon Yorkshire on HS2 Prime Minister, our ambitions deserve more – Leeds and Sheffield leaders speak out in joint editorialIt is co-written by Councillors James Lewis and Terry Fox, the leaders of Leeds and Sheffield City Councils, and their respective chief executives Tom Riordan and Kate Josephs who both have extensive experience of Whitehall.Budget 2021: Northern Powerhouse Rail and HS2 betrayal fears grow – Tom RichmondAnd their shared warning – “making do and mending will not work” – is a strong and stark one amid mounting fears that Ministers intend to turn their backs on this region and its Victorian infrastructure. They must think again.Northern Powerhouse Rail delay is Boris Johnson’s latest ‘great train robbery’ – Tom RichmondFrom this newspaper’s perspective, Boris Johnson’s London government should not under-estimate the public’s sense of betrayal if it proceeds with this ‘great train robbery’ after all its past promises to the North’s 15 million residents about transport investment.They should not under-estimate – or dismiss – the electorate’s mounting incandescence, particularly in marginal ‘red wall’ seats, about a succession of sleaze scandals that have deeply damaged public trust.And they should not under-estimate the charges of hypocrisy to be levelled against Mr Johnson if the Prime Minister fails to lead by example after pleading with world leaders at the COP26 climate change summit to cut emissions.Three reasons why the Government ignores this region at its peril,  Mr Johnson should be advised to recall his formative political years as MP for Henley in the Thames Valley. When Crossrail is open, it will take just over 20 minutes to travel by train from nearby Reading to London – a distance of around 30 miles. Services will be every five minutes.By way of contrast, the fastest journey time between Sheffield and Leeds – a comparative distance – is 40 minutes and the average journey is one hour and six minutes according to Trainline. Services are limited to approximately four an hour on average  due to infrastructure constraints  entirely illustrative of the North-South political, economic, wealth and policy divide.A legacy of decades of under-investment by successive governments – Tory and Labour – HS2 and, critically, Northern Powerhouse Rail, are a once-in-a-generation opportunity, as the two councils stress, to transform rail links, generate jobs, spread prosperity and create new opportunities for people to advance their careers across the whole county and beyond.Yet, if the Government decides to prioritise the HS2 route from London to Birmingham, and then Manchester, it will disadvantage this region incalculably and also compromise the very viability of NPR – its own business case depends on its ability to use the same high-speed rail infrastructure in the North.And to all those, from the Prime Minister and Chancellor Rishi Sunak to ordinary taxpayers who might still view HS2 as an unjustifiable expense after the Covid pandemic, this newspaper commends the words of Leeds and Sheffield Councils.HS2 is not about getting to London quicker. It is about unlocking the economic benefits for our region “decades earlier than expected” if the Government makes a step change in policy and prioritises the connection between Leeds and Sheffield because of its benefits in terms of social mobility and attracting private investment.Two great Yorkshire cities with so much more to offer this county, and country, they now need a high-speed rail  link that is commensurate with their global reputations and their shared ambition to become world leaders when it comes to the net zero agenda and green transport. Again, it is why Boris Johnson – and his Cabinet – ignore Leeds, Sheffield and Yorkshire at their collective peril if they’re committed to levelling up and a carbon-free future. For, if they fail this defining test of policy and trust, they will be condemning this county – and region – to secondary status at a time when it could, and should, be powering the country’s economic revival. They will also, without question, make their route back to power all the more fraught as a betrayal on this scale, should it transpire, will long ring in the ears of the electorate.

501,India's heavy reliance on fossil fuels will remain for some decades to come,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Business Standard,News,1049,,1049,"India, Republic of",,,INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY,INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY,India's heavy reliance on fossil fuels will remain for some decades to come,"India will stay addicted to fossil fuels for decades despite the government's attempts to cast the country as climate conscious and spur investments in clean energy. Growing demand for coal and transport fuels and multi-billion dollar investments in existing and upcoming oil, gas and transport infrastructure crimp a speedy transition to a clean fuel economy.Existing commitments to fossil fuels - critical for expanding affordable energy access to India's price-sensitive economy - was what prompted Prime Minister Narendra Modi to announce a zero-carbon target nearly 50 years into the future at the COP26 summit in Scotland.There's a lot at stake for New Delhi as it mulls a transition from fossil fuels. A rapid transition to electric vehicles (EVs) or renewables risks leaving stranded billions of dollars in downstream assets and hurt prospective investments.India can ill afford such a transition. Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas Hardeep Singh Puri said last month at the India Energy Forum that the country will continue to depend on conventional fuels with gas serving as the energy in transition.The Paris-based International Energy Agency thinks likewise, forecasting India's energy demand to increase by more than any other country in the next 20 years in its India Energy Outlook 2021 report.India's net dependence on imported oil rises to 92 per cent by 2040 based on today's policy settings, from around 83 per cent now, and the thermal fuel import bill triples by 2040, with oil by far the largest component. Oil demand rises by over 40 per cent to 7.1 million barrels a day (mn b/d) in 2030 from 5 mn b/d in 2019, and gains further to 8.7 mn b/d by 2040, the IEA said. Road fuel use will double to 3.8 mn b/d in 2040 from 1.9 mn b/d in 2019 as the total vehicle fleet doubles over the period. India is unlikely to see demand for oil peaking before 2040, HPCL Chairman M K Surana has said. The country still needs to add at least two mn b/d of refining capacity by 2030 - despite aggressive environmental policies - to meet growing demand, IOC chairman SM Vaidya said. Private sector refiner Nayara Energy's CEO Alois Virag sees Indian product demand growing until at least 2035.  Opec, India's biggest oil supply group, is equally sanguine about India's appetite for fossil fuels with Saudi Arabia and Iraq spending tens of billions of dollars to expand production capacity to meet future needs of emerging markets led by India. Opec sees oil demand growing in the short and long terms, and for the fuel to retain the largest share in the energy mix at 28 per cent in 2045. OECD countries' oil demand is unlikely to recover to 2019 levels given an increasing emphasis on a low-carbon future. But non-OECD demand, including India and China, will continue rising to 74.1 mn b/d in 2045 from 48.6 mn b/d in 2020.The government is partly to blame for a growing reliance on fossil fuels. Two key programmes have made the country even more dependent on imported fuels. Import dependency of LPG has risen to as much as 70 per cent in August from around 55 per cent in the past as the government improved access to cooking fuel to over 95 per cent of households from a little over 50 per cent in 2014 via the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana at a cost of over Rs 8,000 crore. Yet another mega-infrastructure project involves doubling India's gas pipeline network and quadrupling access to city gas over the next five years. The target is to increase the share of gas in the country's energy mix to 15 per cent by 2030 from 6-7 per cent now.  Oil and gas will continue to drive India's investments for the next few decades in the post-pandemic era as the government pushes state-oil companies and foreign investors to boost investments in refineries, petrochemicals plants and city gas projects. Saudi Aramco is in talks to buy 20 per cent of Reliance Industries oil-to-chemical business in a $15 billion deal; it is also still considering investing in a much delayed 1.2 mn b/d, $55-billion refinery-cum-petrochemical project in Maharashtra in partnership with Adnoc and Indian oil companies; one of India's biggest-ever investments was Rosneft's acquisition of Essar Oil for $13 billion in 2017, while BPCL's privatisation may yield around $13 billion.State-run companies will spend a combined Rs 2 trillion ($27 billion) to boost Indian refining capacity, according to the oil ministry, with IOC, India's biggest refiner, planning Rs 1 trillion in spending over four or five years in refining and chemicals. By 2030, the government has targeted crude processing capacity to reach 7-8mn b/d.The government estimates investments of Rs 1.2 trillion in the ninth and 10th city gas distribution (CGD) licensing rounds and another Rs 1.2 trillion in the 11th round on the back of plans to double India's existing gas trunk lines to 32,000 km in the next few years. It has awarded 136 geographical areas under the ninth and 10th rounds, covering 70 per cent of the country's population in around 300 districts, according to the oil ministry. The CGD network covered around 20 per cent of the country's population in 2014 when the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance came to power. New Delhi also plans to increase compressed natural gas (CNG) retail outlets to 10,000 from around 3,143 as of end-April, and increase the number of households covered by piped natural gas to 50 million by 2030 from only around 7.9 million currently.State-owned distributor Gail India expects demand for gas to more than triple as a result. OPEC expects India's gas demand to grow by 5.4 per cent a year to reach 3.8 mn b/d of oil equivalent (boe/d) by 2045, with oil consumption rising 3.7 per cent a year to 10.8 mn boe/d by 2045. At the same time, renewable energy use is expected to grow by 11 per cent a year, although this will take it to only 3.6 mn boe/d by 2045.India will need the LNG equivalent of 160 mn t/yr in 2030 to meet energy access targets, with domestic production providing only 40 mn t/yr, according to Petronet LNG. LNG imports could quadruple to 120bn cubic metre in 2040 for from around 30bn cubic metre in 2019, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said. This will entail huge investments in new LNG import facilities in addition to an existing import capacity.",Copyright 2021 Business Standard Private Limited All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY|ENERGY & UTILITY POLICYENERGY DEMANDGREEN FINANCEOUTPUT & DEMANDECONOMIC NEWSENERGY & ENVIRONMENTIMPORT TRADEOIL & GAS DEMANDECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTELECTRIC VEHICLE INDUSTRYEMERGING MARKETSBIOFUELSENERGY EXPORTS & IMPORTSMINERAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENTOIL & GAS EXPORTS & IMPORTSOIL & GAS PRICESPUBLIC POLICYENERGY DEPARTMENTSMANUFACTURING OUTPUTPETROLEUM EXPORTS & IMPORTSSUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATIONTRANSPORTATION SECTOR PERFORMANCEELECTRIC VEHICLESENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCESGOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERSHEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENTPRIME MINISTERSELECTRIC MOBILITY|ALTERNATIVE & RENEWABLE ENERGYENERGY & UTILITIESENERGY & UTILITY POLICYENERGY DEMANDGREEN FINANCEENERGY & ENVIRONMENTNATURAL GAS PRODUCTSOIL & GAS DEMANDOIL & GAS INDUSTRYPETROLEUM PRODUCTSELECTRIC VEHICLE INDUSTRYBIOFUELSENERGY EXPORTS & IMPORTSMINERAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENTNATURAL GASOIL & GAS EXPORTS & IMPORTSOIL & GAS PRICESTRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTUREENERGY DEPARTMENTSMANUFACTURING OUTPUTPETROLEUM EXPORTS & IMPORTSSUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATIONTRANSPORTATION SECTOR PERFORMANCEELECTRIC VEHICLESCOAL INDUSTRYELECTRIC MOBILITY|NARENDRA MODI|NEW DELHI, INDIA|INDIAIRAQSAUDI ARABIASCOTLAND",
502,Industry says reactors are nearly ready,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Sydney Morning Herald (Australia),News,560,NEWS;Pg. 25,560,Australia,Latika Bourke,,ROLLS-ROYCE AUSTRALIA LTD,ROLLS-ROYCE AUSTRALIA LTD,Industry says reactors are nearly ready,"London: Rolls-Royce says the AUKUS security agreement between Australia, Britain and the US paves the way for Australia to embrace small modular nuclear reactors.This week Rolls-Royce announced it had raised nearly £500 million ($915 million) in government and private equity funding to build its small modular reactor design.Currently, no such reactors exist anywhere in the world, although China began construction of its first plant in July.Rolls-Royce believes it could begin building its first reactor in 2030 if it is given regulatory approval. It submitted the paperwork to regulators on Wednesday.A small modular reactor is roughly the size of two soccer pitches and about one-tenth the size of Britain's existing nuclear plants. Rolls Royce claims it would produce the same amount of power generated by 150 onshore wind turbines, enough to supply 1 million homes.Speaking exclusively to The Sydney Morning Herald, the chief executive of the company's small modular reactor division, Todd Samson, said the technology was the same as that used to power Britain's nuclear submarine fleet - technology Australia could acquire under the AUKUS agreement.""With AUKUS, Australia has now got a new opportunity in front of it. If you are going to embrace nuclear as part of your defence program, then you would be the only country that had done so and did not then fully exploit a commercial, civil nuclear program,"" Mr Samson said.""So you have the option now. Whether the public and the perceptions in Australia would open up to nuclear as their part of their net-zero ambitions, I don't know,"" he said.His calls echo those of the Minerals Council of Australia, which in September said the development of a nuclear submarine fleet would give the nation an opportunity to develop nuclear power capacity.""Not only will we develop the skills and infrastructure to support this naval technology, but it connects us to the growing global nuclear power industry and its supply chains,"" said chief executive Tania Constable.""While Australia has one-third of the world's uranium supplies, it has limited its nuclear capacity to a single world-class medical research reactor at Lucas Heights in Sydney.""But Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said Australia will not build new nuclear plants and will continue to meet all nuclear non-proliferation obligations.The role of nuclear energy has become a key debating point at the COP26 summit. As well as helping fund Rolls-Royce's project, Britain has commissioned the first of three conventional new nuclear plants and France this week announced it would upgrade its nuclear network for the first time in decades.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said Britain will be powered entirely by clean electricity by 2035, with funding for a second large-scale nuclear plant finalised this parliamentary term and the option kept open for mini-plants.By contrast, nuclear energy has been fiercely rejected in Australia, where a moratorium exists. In 2019, a majority-government parliamentary committee recommended the consideration of small modular reactors, but only with bipartisan and public support.But in a dissenting report, Labor MPs rejected nuclear power in any form, describing it as a ""dangerous distraction"". Opponents say even the smaller nuclear plants produce radioactive waste and cost far more than renewables.",Copyright 2021 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|ROLLS-ROYCE AUSTRALIA LTD|AGREEMENTSNEW MANUFACTURING FACILITIESPLANT CONSTRUCTIONARMS CONTROL & DISARMAMENTBRITISH PRIME MINISTERSELECTRICITY GENERATING CAPACITYNUCLEAR PLANT SAFETYNUCLEAR WEAPONSHEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENTPRIME MINISTERSSUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENTWIND ENERGY INDUSTRYPRIVATE EQUITYAPPROVALSEXECUTIVESMEDICAL RESEARCHMEDICINE & HEALTH|NUCLEAR ENERGYNUCLEAR POWER PLANTSENERGY & UTILITIESENERGY & UTILITY CONSTRUCTIONNEW MANUFACTURING FACILITIESPLANT CONSTRUCTIONELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRYELECTRIC POWER PLANTSELECTRICITY GENERATING CAPACITYENERGY & UTILITY REGULATION & POLICYNAVAL VESSELSNUCLEAR PLANT SAFETYNUCLEAR WEAPONSUTILITIES INDUSTRYALTERNATIVE & RENEWABLE ENERGYWIND ENERGYWIND ENERGY INDUSTRYDEFENSE ELECTRONICSPRIVATE EQUITYSUBMARINES & SUBMERSIBLES|BORIS JOHNSONSCOTT MORRISON|SYDNEY, AUSTRALIALONDON, ENGLAND|AUSTRALIAUNITED KINGDOMUNITED STATES",

Camilla took on the role of the late Prince Philip as she laid a wreath at the tomb of the Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey.And she met veterans at the Field of Remembrance outside as they marked 103 years since the end of World War One.Big Ben, which had been silenced for repairs, bonged once again at the start of the two minutes' Armistice Day silence.It came as Buckingham Palace said it is the Queen's ""firm intention"" to lead the National Service of Remembrance at the Cenotaph in London on Sunday.She has been under doctors' orders to rest after a night in hospital on October 20.Prince Charles, who was at a separate event in South London yesterday, was asked by a member of the public: ""How is your mother?""He replied: ""She's all right, thank you."" The Queen, 95, led a Privy Council meeting by video link from Windsor on Wednesday but is not expected to attend the annual festival of remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall tomorrow.Outside the abbey, Chelsea Pensioner Peter Fullelove, 88, a former Black Watch private, joked with Camilla about the colour of his red coat.He said: ""I asked the duchess if she stopped because she liked the colour of my coat and she said she did.""Prime Minister Boris Johnson posted a photograph of him observing the two-minute silence at Downing Street. He said: ""On the eleventh hour, of the eleventh day, of the eleventh month, the guns fell silent. Today, as then, we will remember them.""In Edinburgh, little Grace Pettie, just 18 months old, laid down a poppy for fallen heroes in the shadow of the Scott Monument as a single shot was fired from the Castle.In Glasgow, Secretary-General of the United Nations António Guterres led a two-minute silence at COP26 alongside event president Alok Sharma and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, right.Veterans, staff and visitors at Erskine home in Bishopton, Renfrewshire, also fell silent to remember all those who gave their lives in service.And 13,000 hand-crocheted poppies were put on display in Macduff, Aberdeenshire.In Glasgow, hundreds marked the day, including in the city's George Square, where many paused to reflect.Remembrance services across Britain and around the world were the first involving large numbers of veterans, troops and the public since Covid restrictions eased.Hundreds gathered at the Cenotaph and the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire.In Ypres on the Western Front, Belgium's Prime Minister Alexander De Croo read the poem For the Fallen at the Menin Gate.In Paris, President Emmanuel Macron was joined by US Vice President Kamala Harris for a service on the Champs Elysees.They embraced under the Arc de Triomphe in a sign relations have thawed since France withdrew its ambassador to America over being cut out of the AUKUS sub deal.lVICTORIA Cross hero Johnson Beharry, 41, thanked everyone who wears a poppy after he marked the two minutes' silence in Watford.

505,Ireland joins alliance committed to phasing out oil and gas production;Group to push for international agreement on end date for exploration of fossil fuels,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Irish Times,News,530,IRELAND;Pg. 3,530,Ireland,Kevin O'Sullivan,,,,Ireland joins alliance committed to phasing out oil and gas productionGroup to push for international agreement on end date for exploration of fossil fuels," An alliance of countries has committed to phasing out production of oil and gas - and is to push for an international agreement on setting an end date for the exploration and extraction of fossil fuels. The commitment, made at Cop26 is seen is highly significant.The launch of the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (BOGA), which Ireland has joined, is a first in an international climate process which up to now has focused on limiting carbon emissions from fossil fuels rather than turning off the tap. The 2015 Paris Agreement did not even mention fossil fuels, which generated 91 per cent of human-induced carbon emissions in 2020.The alliance is seeking to curtail new licensing and undertake other measures to phase out oil and gas production in line with the Paris accord. Ireland joined Costa Rica; Denmark, France, Greenland, Quebec, Sweden, Wales, California and New Zealand in making the milestone announcement.Powerful message Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan said: ""Ireland is leading the way in incentivising the transition to renewable energy and putting ourselves on a pathway to net zero, by legislating to keep fossil fuels in the ground. The decision we have made today sends a powerful message we are moving irrevocably away from fossil fuels towards a renewable future - both in Ireland and internationally.""""Through the Climate Act 2021, Ireland has closed the door on new exploration activities for oil and gas. There is no longer a legal basis for granting new licences,"" he underlined. In line with Government policy of keeping fossil fuels in the ground, ""we are also currently legislating to prohibit exploration for and extraction of coal, lignite and oil shale"", Mr Ryan confirmed. Mr Ryan added: ""By prohibiting offshore oil and gas exploration, not only are we doing what we need to do to address climate change, we are also protecting our biodiversity which is intrinsically linked to climate change.""Denmark and Costa Rica led the initiative. Denmark's minister for climate, energy, and utilities Dan Jorgensen said that it was expensive for his country as it was the largest producer of oil in the EU but ""we do it because we believe we need to"".""There's no future for oil and gas in a 1.5-degree world,"" he added.Concrete actions Costa Rica's environment minister Andrea Meza said the alliance was about early movers showing courage, ""backed by concrete actions"".""It's a big deal,"" said Harro van Assel of Stockholm Environment Institute. ""It's the first time governments are committing together to phase down oil and gas production.""Jerry Mac Evilly, head of polity at Friends of the Earth Ireland said Ireland's participation in BOGA was hugely positive. ""Ireland has taken important steps in recent years to phase out fossil fuels, from ending new oil and gas exploration, to banning onshore fracking. However with the new alliance we are now finally seeing domestic progress being reflected in foreign policy."" Meanwhile, the Government has also allocated EUR 2 million to the Climate and Clean Air Coalition to cut short-lived pollutants including methane and to reduce air pollution - an initiative that has been led by US climate envoy John Kerry.",Copyright 2021 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|AGREEMENTSCLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION & POLICYEMISSIONSINTERNATIONAL LAWOIL & GAS OUTPUTOIL PRODUCTION STATISTICSCLIMATE CHANGEGREENHOUSE GASESGOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERSEUROPEAN UNIONENERGY DEPARTMENTSOIL & GAS INCENTIVESENERGY & ENVIRONMENTENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCESCOAL PRODUCTION STATISTICSENVIRONMENTAL & WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONSENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTSENVIRONMENTAL LAWOFFSHORE ENERGYOFFSHORE OIL & GAS EXPLORATION & EXTRACTIONGOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONRENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRYBIODIVERSITYPUBLIC POLICY|OIL & GAS INDUSTRYENERGY & UTILITIESEMISSIONSNATURAL GAS EXTRACTIONOIL & GAS EXPLORATION & EXTRACTIONOIL & GAS OUTPUTOIL PRODUCTION STATISTICSENERGY DEPARTMENTSOIL & GAS EXPLORATIONOIL & GAS INCENTIVESOIL EXPLORATIONENERGY & ENVIRONMENTPROSPECTING & EXPLORATIONCOAL PRODUCTION STATISTICSOFFSHORE ENERGYOFFSHORE OIL & GAS EXPLORATION & EXTRACTIONALTERNATIVE & RENEWABLE ENERGYRENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRY|PARIS, FRANCESTOCKHOLM, SWEDEN|CALIFORNIA, USA|IRELANDCOSTA RICADENMARKFRANCEGREENLANDSWEDENEUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES",
506,Irony of teachers' 'freedom',"November 12, 2021",International,The New Zealand Herald,News,1312,OPINION;Pg. A032,1312,New Zealand,,,,,Irony of teachers' 'freedom',"There is a strange irony in seeing teachers and some principals refusing the Covid-19 vaccination because they believe that this could compromise their freedom of choice.  I am assuming that this philosophy of freedom of choice extends to others, in particular, their students. For example, at the end of the lunch break, they would find it acceptable for their students and staff to exercise free choice, and remain in the playground with their friends. And, in the classroom, that students could refuse to engage in certain areas of learning such as maths or social science because they wish to choose what they ""put in their minds"" or because they disagree with the tenets of that area of learning.  As a teacher for the past 60 years, I discovered quite early in my career that the most powerful tool in a teacher's repertoire apart from competence in teaching ""subjects"" was showing, by example, in and out of the classroom the attitudes and behaviours that contribute to making the world a peaceful, productive, co-operative place.  I should have thought that having the vaccine was one way that teachers could help to make their classroom and community a safe, peaceful environment.  Claire Ferguson, Blockhouse Bay.  Holding pattern  Richard Prebble's expose (NZ Herald, November 10) is a revelation. It is a scandal that 3500 prisoners are on remand. We should immediately release at least 1000.  A formula based on probable penalty/months in remand would be quite easy to calculate. Two provisos should apply. Fully vaccinated and with an approved home to go to.  To prevent the numbers growing again maybe we could consider paying judges a bonus to spend more hours in court. Twenty per week should be the base level.  Murray Reid, Cambridge.  Individual contributions  Siegfried Jordan (NZ Herald, November 10) makes an excellent point when he suggests that we all need to change our habits, as communities and individuals, to mitigate the effects of climate change. Glaswegians are being asked to contribute by suggesting improvements to their city; such as spaces that could be car-free and the establishment of small urban forests. Our council could do the same. For a start we needn't mow as extensively as we do.  On an individual level, every family could brainstorm on how to minimise its carbon footprint by a third. It could be as simple as using less power and less water and buying locally-produced seasonal food.  New Zealand could then fulfil its obligations to climate accord without it being a big drama or pointing fingers and using evasive statistical number crunching.  Wendy Pettersen, Devonport.  Altared states  In his efforts to appease the gods of climate change, it appears our high priest James Shaw and his COP26 prophets are willing to sacrifice even our world's food supplies.  Unable to reach for carbon, the low-hanging fruit of methane makes for such easy pickings. Their grapes of beef, dairy and rice agriculture are to be plucked, squeezed, crushed and the blood poured out on the altar of the god of climate to appease her coming wrath.  As poor people starve to death, the smoke of coal, clouds of diesel and fumes of petrol continue to pollute our air and darken the light of the Sun, revelation and reason.  The God of Creation laughs as mankind exposes his inherent selfishness.  Dave Stanton, Geraldine.  Ill-thought density  As a property professional, and someone developing four townhouses of three levels, but in the appropriate Terrace Housing Apartment zone, I feel the medium density residential standards (MDRS ) is nonsense.  The unitary plan has evolved over eight years and is not yet fully operative. The MDRS proposal basically throws much of this plan out the window.  I believe National was foolish to be a party to this, they will only be left with themselves to blame. Understandably councils are unhappy with both their water resource and development controls being taken from them abruptly with little ""consultation"".  The unitary plan already radically changed zoning - where most properties on say 675sq m could have one house plus a minor unit, now they can have up to five units in the most common mixed housing suburban zone.  This proposal also has the effect of devaluing properties in the previously more intensive zones, which buyers have paid large premiums for. It may increase the value of other previously lower-density zoned properties in the short term, but over time will decrease the amenity of these areas.  Rene Mclean, Howick.  Dud notes  I couldn't believe my ears when I heard the news that the Government is going to guarantee music festival organisers $200 million if their event for some reason doesn't go ahead, and to really add insult to the taxpayer the festival organisers will be able to keep any ticket sales proceeds as well as the government payout.  Surely the Government has greater priorities for $200 million than guaranteeing festivals? For example, funding more life-saving drugs for Pharmac. Is there any more craziness to come from this Government?  Jock Mac Vicar, Hauraki.  Mismatched mandates  Wouldn't it be sensible to mandate vaccination for the entire population unless someone has a valid medical reason for not having it? The present mismatch of some workplaces being required to and some not suggests to me that it will only partially be effective, for example in secondary schools what is the point in mandating the staff if the students are allowed to attend unvaccinated?  Warren Cossey, Morrinsville.  Plenty of advice  Who would you turn to for advice on how to control a pandemic?  Self-appointed amateur experts? Paid advocates for business groups? Tourist operators? Occasional media personalities and columnists? Any of the above? Yeah right.  Or experienced scientists and epidemiologists? Right on.  Derek Smith, Newmarket.  Freedom granted  We have heard an awful lot lately about rights and freedom of choice. The wonderful thing about rights is that everyone has them, not just the minority groups where the noise is coming from. And we all have freedom of choice, which actually means living with the outcomes of our choices.  And when large numbers are making choices, then the outcomes of those choices can and will clash, because on this Earth no one has absolute right.  So three cheers to Singapore for deciding to bar those who choose not to be vaccinated, from free medical care for Covid-19. One could mount a strong argument that this is not discrimination at all, but a rather graphic demonstration of choices and outcomes.  Phil Chitty, Albany.  Drawing a comparison  When Churchill said ""lights out and close your curtains"" during the Blitz, did people say ""it's my right to have my lights on, to read my book, to enjoy the fresh air?"" Perhaps that generation was a little bit smarter, more community-minded and not so obsessed with their personal ""free-dumb"".  Roger Laybourn, Hamilton.  Still wise words  Many years ago I was chatting with the now late Ray Boord, who used to be a Labour MP and mayor of Rotorua. He said to me, ""Bruce, it is not about your legal rights, it is about your moral responsibilities.""

507,Is this the moment that breaks ministers' fragile loyalty to Boris Johnson?,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,standard.co.uk,News,759,"COMMENT,COMMENT;Version:1",759,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Katy Balls,,,,Is this the moment that breaks ministers' fragile loyalty to Boris Johnson?,"When Downing Street  has completely abandoned its position, U-turning so comprehensively that even the person sacked for not following the party line had been given their job back, it is clear that the Government  knows it got things wrong.Yet when Rishi Sunak  acknowledged yesterday that it needs ""to do better"" in the wake of the Owen Paterson  fiasco, it was enough to make MPs  stop and listen. The reason? It's more than the Prime Minister  has been prepared to say since the Tory sleaze row broke out last week. Despite mounting criticism, Boris Johnson  has refused to apologise.""He's gone further than the Prime Minister in showing contrition,"" says one Tory MP. Sunak fits into a trend. He is one of a number of ministers more willing than Johnson to express regret after a tawdry few days for the Government. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi  suggested the vote plot was a mistake while Stephen Barclay in the chamber spoke of regret. The Prime Minister takes the view that apologising is a sign of weakness that gives in to media pressure. ""He's incredibly stubborn,"" says a former aide. But in the face of an ongoing scandal, his ministers are coming to their own conclusions. Nearly a fortnight after the Tory sleaze row began, it is showing little sign of dying down, with stories each day questioning MPs on potential conflicts of interest over second jobs. Ministers complain that Johnson's mishandling of the situation - with No10's attempt to spare Paterson a 30-day suspension - has led to a situation that they can no longer control. There is sheer fury it walked into an elephant trap. Senior Tories warned that wading into the Paterson row would open the door to a potential crackdown on outside interests.Johnson's refusal to show up for Monday's emergency debate - let alone apologise - only helped to keep the story going. Had he just faced the music early on, MPs argue, the worst would now be over. While backbench MPs harrumphing over No10 is nothing new, what's telling is how members of the Cabinet are more willing to go off script than before. Since Johnson entered Downing Street, he has been criticised for failing to lead a cabinet government. Rather than appoint ministers who will challenge him or raise objections, the Prime Minister has a tendency to reward loyalty. It has seen both his Cabinet and advisers branded as ""yes men"", with figures such as former Education Secretary Gavin Williamson seen to be picked for their support in the leadership contest rather than their competence. Even in the most recent reshuffle this was on show - while Williamson faced the axe, loyalty was still a valuable commodity. Nadine Dorries, the new Culture Secretary, is a long-time supporter - while the big winner from the moves is Liz Truss, who was promoted to Foreign Secretary and was Johnson's first Cabinet backer during his leadership bid. Cabinet meetings don't tend to be the scene for debate either with ministers rarely consulted on key decisions. But as Johnson comes under pressure from his own party, could this start to change? It's what ministers hope for.Johnson's relationship with the Tory party is a transactional one and this applies to the Cabinet as well as the parliamentary party. When Dominic Cummings departed No10, ministers hoped it would herald a return to cabinet government. Instead they found that the same issues remained just in a new form. ""There was a lot of 'we are listening' and 'reaching out' but actually very little has changed,"" says one government aide. Ministers still complain that they find it hard to get a meeting in the Prime Minister's diary - with Downing Street aides failing to respond on WhatsApp or through action. Going forward, one predicts more questioning the next time there is a Downing Street edict. After all, it's not clear whether blind loyalty really is in their best interest.Not only are the Tories sliding in the polls as a result of Johnson's plan, in the reshuffle, loyalists Robert Jenrick and Robert Buckland both found themselves turfed out despite having turned up to take the heat for the Government on many a difficult news day. It's part of the reasons ministers out this week defending the Government are showing more contrition. These aren't words anyone is hearing from Johnson - nor does anyone expect to right now. But ministers are starting to find voices of their own.

508,Joining forces against existential threat,"November 12, 2021",International,i - Independent Print Ltd,News,344,NEWS;Pg. 10,344,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Geoffrey Lean,,,,Joining forces against existential threat,"As in a movie plot where warring nations unite to fight invaders from outer space, China and America have come together to fight the ""existential"" threat of climate change.The surprise initiative by the planet's two biggest polluters has provided hope that we may yet avoid global heating escalating out of control, lightened the fraught COP26 atmosphere and raised the prospect of increasing action this decade. The agreement, which is expected to lead to a virtual meeting between Biden and Xi as early as next week, owes much to the trust between their top envoys, John Kerry andXie Zhenhua. They have known each other for 20 years - working together to help secure the 2015 Paris climate agreement. The dry negotiations behind the new initiative were irrigated by anecdotes about grandchildren, Xie's garden and Kerry's holiday home.Kerry fought off China hawks in the Biden administration to engage. They have met 30 times virtually in recent months,and twice in person. Even as their Presidents attacked each other at COP, they met most days.US-China relations are fundamental to climate negotiations. They were at loggerheads at a 2009 Copenhagen summit, which failed. In 2014, Kerry and Xie hammered out a programme of action that paved the way for Paris. This week's initiative is not as comprehensive, but commits to ""accelerated actions"" in this ""critical decade"".China will try to speed up its phasing down of coal use. Though it resisted pressure from Kerry to bring forward its planned peaking of emissions from 2030, there is hope that will happen.Most importantly, China resolved, to develop an ""ambitious"" plan to cut emissions of the gas. While it has not joined the Global Methane Pledge, the two countries will meet next year to follow through.Glasgow talks could still fail. Biden is likely to lose his congressional majorities to climate-denying Republicans next year, and may lose the presidency in 2024. Xi (inset) has trouble persuading China's provinces to accept green measures. Yet, in Xie's words, both see the challenge is ""existential"".",Copyright 2021 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

511,KKR gets JobKeeper to pitch in,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Australian,News,1142,BUSINESS;Pg. 14,1142,Australia,MARGIN CALL WITH MELISSA YEO & CHRISTINE LACY,,,,KKR gets JobKeeper to pitch in,"We're not sure this is what our great leader would describe as ""can-do capitalism"" - Australia's second biggest pub group, the private equity-owned Australian Venue Co, has been saved from descent into the red for the second year running by $31.1m in Covid-related government subsidies.AVC has more than 170 pub, restaurant and bar venues in Australia and New Zealand and is owned by American giant KKR, which has more than $US220bn in assets under management around the world.According to accounts seen by Margin Call, AVC, which is run by Paul Waterson, finished the 2021 financial year with $83m cash in the bank (up from $44m the year before) and owning its lenders $411.5m.The $31.1m in JobKeeper payments was in addition to $22.9m collected in government wage subsidies the year before.The group's net profit result of $18.8m compared with a whopping $107.4m loss previously, amid forced Covid closures in both financial years.Waterson, who over the course of the pandemic has been a vocal advocate for the hospitality industry, says in his annual report that AVC spent the year focused on cash management and cost reductions and that the group was pursuing a growth strategy via developments and acquisitions to drive revenue and increase margins.Despite repeated lockdowns, AVC generated revenue in the year to July 27 of $579.5m from $489.8m the year before.But help with wages wasn't the only hand-out provided to the private equiteers. ""As a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, additional support has been provided by government in the form of grant income, combined with deferrals and waivers of various taxes and licence fees,"" the annual report reveals.In May KKR cancelled plans to float AVC via a $1bn listing to raise about $350m in fresh -equity. The offer was pulled thanks to the enduring impact of the pandemic.Waterson has assured, however, that AVC has sufficient cash and available debt facilities to continue as a ""going concern"".""Subsequent to the reporting date, the group has monitored its ability to remain a going concern,"" the report reveals.""The group has run sensitivity analysis on all key judgments, estimates and assumptions impacting the consolidated financial statements at the reporting date and no adjustments have been identified.""The group remains exposed to uncertainties associated with the location and duration of current and future lockdowns, the nature and extent of pandemic-related government support, ongoing negotiations with suppliers and landlords and the pace of recovery in activity once lockdown restrictions are lifted.""The impact of these may be material."" KKR is represented on the pub group's board by Gareth Woodbridge and Scott Bookmyer.Despite the difficult times, AVC also managed to make 11 acquisitions in the year, with more planned in the current operating year.Cheers to that.Kew candidates Disgraced state liberal minister Tim Smith's loss has opened up quite the competition for preselection in his blue-ribbon seat of Kew, and with nominations closing on Friday there's sure to be plenty of action still.Smith's decision not to contest the election, after his boozy weekend joy ride late on October 30, has seen Jess Wilson, former adviser to Josh Frydenberg and once president of the Young Liberals, touted by many as a favourite for the seat, especially given backing from the Treasurer himself who commands the corresponding Federal seat of Kooyong.But those close to the party in Victoria tell Margin Call the race is far from over, and are all too keen to point out the controversy surrounding Wilson's husband Aaron Lane, who himself for a time was up for an Upper House seat before a controversy over crude Twitter comments saw him resign ahead of the 2014 election and lose his job at Deakin.Of course, there's been plenty of water under the bridge since then, with Lane picking himself up a doctorate from RMIT in the meantime, and cementing himself as an expert in all things blockchain law.But if the past two weeks have shown anything it is that the field is nothing if not dynamic. Only late Thursday did Liberal MP David Davis emerge as a prospective goer, said to be encouraged by party powerbrokers to nominate for the seat.Elsewhere, Monica Clark, a former candidate in the seat of Ivanhoe, is said to be in the mix, as is lawyer and Tennis Australia director Virginia Wallace and a smattering of local councillors such as Cynthia Watson, Nick Savrou and Felicity Sinfield.Opportunity lost While political leaders rush to flex their electric vehicle credentials post-COP26, it seems Victorian premier Dan Andrews and his government have missed a key opportunity lying right under their noses.It was revealed this week that a planned electric vehicle factory to be built by local outfit SEA Electric in Victoria's Latrobe Valley would no longer go ahead, contrary to a promise by Andrews announced ahead of the 2018 election.That has got locals fired up, with the loss of the promised 500 jobs in the former coal-fired power station region a heavy blow.But you can hardly say the collapse of the deal comes as a surprise. President and founder Tony Fairweather has long expressed his frustration towards the government relating to the deal, writing urgent correspondence as early as the start of last year.In a letter to secretary of the department of jobs, precincts and regions Simon Phemister in March 2020, seen by Margin Call, Fairweather escalates a number of issues, requesting an urgent meeting with Andrews and his then-regional development minister Jaclyn Symes to address the urgent need for working capital via the government's prior commitment.""I am incredulous that, in the current calamitous environment, your team has made it clear, in writing, that the state will not advance the funds to SEA that have been agreed with your personal imprimatur - or consent to the new facility. These funds are critical to maintaining and securing jobs in Victoria,"" Fairweather wrote.""Indeed, it is our clearest intention that manufacturing jobs will remain in Victoria and we are doing everything humanly possible to achieve this."" The rest is history, with SEA Electric then proceeding to shift its operations to Los Angeles where it now churns out its electric drive systems for commercial trucks across several continents.And as such, its backers now have a distinctly international flavour including global energy and commodities trading house Hartree Partners and TSE-listed Exro Technologies.That is, aside from the likes of Phil King's Regal Funds Management and IDP Education director Christopher Leptos, formerly SEA's chairman and an adviser to Tony Burgess's Flagstaff Partners.Victoria's loss seems to be a gain at least for some, though hardly consolation for Latrobe Valley locals.INSIDE MARGIN CALL Opportunity lost for Victorian Premier Dan Andrews",Copyright 2021 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|The Australian|ENGLISH|RESTAURANTS & FOOD SERVICE SECTOR PERFORMANCEANNUAL REPORTSCOVID CORONAVIRUSFINANCIAL RESULTSPANDEMICSPRIVATE EQUITYREPORTS, REVIEWS & SECTIONSCOMPANY STRATEGYPUBLIC FINANCECOVID-19 CORONAVIRUSGOVERNMENT GRANTS & SUBSIDIESHOSPITALITY SECTOR PERFORMANCEANNUAL FINANCIAL RESULTSCOMPANY EARNINGSFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE & REPORTSCOMPANY PROFITSCOVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICYINFECTIOUS DISEASE|DRINKING PLACESRESTAURANTSRESTAURANTS & FOOD SERVICE INDUSTRYRESTAURANTS & FOOD SERVICE SECTOR PERFORMANCEPRIVATE EQUITYHOSPITALITY SECTOR PERFORMANCE|AUSTRALIANEW ZEALANDUNITED STATESAUSTRALIA & NEW ZEALAND",
512,"Korea, Germany share circular economy vision","November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Korea Times,News,724,,724,"Korea, Republic of",Kwon Mee-yoo,,,,"Korea, Germany share circular economy vision","By Kwon Mee-yooWith increased interest in a circular economy, as discussed at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), the German Embassy in Korea and the Korean-German Chamber of Commerce (KGCCI) held a conference discussing policies, strategies and practices for a circular economy in Germany and Korea.A circular economy is a sustainable production and consumption model which offers a way to fight global climate change and reduce carbon emissions.Michael Reiffenstuel, German ambassador to Korea, emphasized the importance of a circular economy as a way to sustainable management of resources, in the opening remarks.'Managing waste is not just about waste disposal. Waste is a valuable resource which can be used effectively to conserve natural resources, protect our environment and our climate,' Reiffenstuel said, mentioning there are 832 different types of waste, from paper and electrical equipment to construction and plant waste.'Korea and Germany share many similarities: we both are highly industrialized, export-oriented nations with a focus on manufacturing; we both have an interest in sustainable and affordable supply of natural resources; and we are both strongly committed to climate protection. Korean and German expertise and spirit of innovation complement each other. This conference provides a valuable opportunity for both countries to share their experiences and discuss strategies on circular economy.'KGCCI President & CEO Martin Henkelmann noted that this is the perfect time to discuss the circular economy in Germany and Korea, as usage and disposal of plastic has increased significantly in recent years.'Korea and Germany face similar challenges and have many opportunities for cooperation in the field of recycling and reusing valuable resources while reducing their consumption,' Henkelmann said.'As highly developed countries with state-of-the-art waste collection and processing possibilities, they are already on a steady path to strengthening the circular economy. Perfecting these systems through joint investment as well as through bilateral research and development is pivotal to overcome the challenges.'Hanyang University chemical engineering professor Sang Byoung-in moderated the event, discussing regulatory frameworks and strategies of the circular economy as well as implementation and successful practices.Alexander Maak, managing director of ALBA Services which provides a 'zero waste solution,' delivered a keynote speech on sustainability.'A circular economy leads to an endless system of sustainability if companies make active use of the intersection between economic, feasible and scalable business models,' Maak said.Maak also provided examples of circular economy business models, such as identifying the right sources of materials and logistics as well as recycling to achieve zero waste.In the first session, Yoo Yong-ho, deputy director of Resources Circulation Policy Division from the Korean Ministry of Environment, explained Korea's circular economy plan, which aims to ensure quality of life while pursuing sustainable economic growth through improvement of resource efficiency.Andreas Jaron, head of the Circular Economy Division at Germany's Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, gave a briefing on German waste management. Jaron noted that a circular economy has the goal of using resources as efficiently as possible.'In the past, circular economy was waste management more or less with implications to the whole economy, but now it's the efficient use of resources at each stage of the economy. Circular economy is not one policy, but an umbrella over various areas ― it can be resource policy, product design, production, logistics, digitalization, consumption, waste management and probably other policy areas. But the principle is to use less resources,' Jaron said.Hong Soo-yeol, the director of the Resource Circulation Society Economic Research Institute and a member of the 2050 Carbon Neutrality Commission, addressed opportunities and challenges of a circular economy in Korea.In the second session, circular economy examples were presented from the private and public sectors, including German company Sesotec, Korean company Machine & Technology and Korea's Ansan City in Gyeonggi Province.Link to Image",Copyright 2021 The Korea Times All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|Nation|CIRCULAR ECONOMYECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORSCLIMATE CHANGEEMBASSIES & CONSULATESENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCESGREEN ECONOMYINTERNATIONAL RELATIONSCLIMATOLOGYCOMPANY ACTIVITIES & MANAGEMENTCONFERENCES & CONVENTIONSEXECUTIVESSUSTAINABILITYSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTEMERGING MARKETSCONSUMPTIONECONOMIC CONDITIONSUNITED NATIONSUNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONSECONOMIC POLICYTRADE DEVELOPMENTCONSERVATIONENGINEERINGENVIRONMENTALISMMANAGERS & SUPERVISORSNATURAL RESOURCESRESEARCH & DEVELOPMENTSUSTAINABLE MANUFACTURINGENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTSSOLID WASTE TREATMENT & DISPOSALECONOMIC GROWTHEMISSIONSEXPORT TRADEGREENHOUSE GASESCHAMBERS OF COMMERCECHEMICAL ENGINEERINGCOLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS|CIRCULAR ECONOMYGREEN ECONOMYWASTE MANAGEMENT & REMEDIATION SERVICESSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTENGINEERINGMANUFACTURINGSUSTAINABLE MANUFACTURINGSOLID WASTE TREATMENT & DISPOSALEMISSIONSCHEMICAL ENGINEERINGCOLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS|MURRAY D MARTIN|GERMANYKOREA, REPUBLIC OF",

They litter our coasts, pollute our oceans and contribute to the climate emergency.""That has to end and this ban will be another step forward in the fight against plastic waste and throwaway culture.""This is another example of the sort of bold action that is needed if we are to deliver on the commitments that are being made at Cop26.""

He normally doesn't like to roll out of bed till the crack of midday.And then rather than have his breakfast and go back to bed, lying across my feet while I sit at my desk - his early warning system in case I should move and he miss a treat opportunity - I gave him a big hug, left a list of chores for The Dark Lord to ignore, and ran to catch the 8.05am train to London.It was my first day back in the office. Luckily just the one so far, as I'm not entirely sure I have a full week's worth of clean underwear having not managed to put any washing away since 2009. It comes out of the clean washing basket and then into the dirty - I really should just dispense with the middleman and get rid of the drawers.The train was empty, which was hardly surprising given the outrageous cost of a South Western ticket.

As far as I know, COP26 is not even going to mention the world\xE2s fast growing population, and without tackling that, how can other promises to control global warming be met? For example, how can we stop the destruction of forests when increasing millions are desperate for food, and tens of thousands of farmers are desperate for land to grow it on?How can we provide enough food and decent conditions of living for billions more people in the next few generations without major loss of wildlife and natural beauty which we all treasure? The predictions are frightning.Many readers would be shocked to learn how many millions of women, and men for that matter, are not educated in, or given access to , any kind of birth control. Unbelievably, some countries still encourage large families for nationalist reasons, and developed countries avoid encouraging action in the Third World. Indeed, recent cuts to UK aid budgets has directly impacted education on contraception in some areas.Will those in power not address this matter before it is too late?MARTYN DOWELLSouthampton",Copyright 2021 NewsQuest Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved,,Newspaper|ENGLISH|NEGATIVE MISC NEWSNEGATIVE NEWSDEFORESTATIONWILDLIFEGLOBAL WARMING|BUDGETSDEFORESTATIONGLOBAL WARMING,
518,"Letters: In many situations, cash still has plenty of value","November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Daily Advertiser,News,556,OPINION;Pg. 11,556,Australia,,,,,"Letters: In many situations, cash still has plenty of value","CASH STILL HAS PLENTY OF VALUE Following on from Robert T Walker's letter (""Bemused at cash ban decision"", November 10) I can add another dimension to the situation.The notion that businesses can operate fully cashless is spreading quickly across our modern society, which is what has prompted the owners of The Birdhouse to proclaim they will operate on that basis in future.This total dependence on technology to conduct a business is rather brave, to say the least, if you consider the regular interruptions to secure transactions via the current systems.A simple blackout halts most businesses' ability to trade.Given the ever increasing reliance on renewables with intermittent supply security, blackouts will be more common.Just recently severe storms across southern Australia widely disrupted electronic transactions. Sometimes for days.Tills could not be unlocked, so businesses couldn't trade.People who ""never carry cash these days"" were lined up at the rare ATM they could find within reasonable distance, to get cash out just for their lunch money.And banks have been removing ATMs faster than they have been closing bank branches in rural areas.A couple of years ago, a major fire in an electricity sub-station in western Victoria led to a complete loss of access for all types of business transactions.Across an area of some hundreds of kilometres, many small and medium-sized towns were bereft of all transactional services, along with internet and phone contact. It took a month to restore services.How long did it take to repair systems across the areas affected by bushfires in the Black Summer fires?We are constantly told there will be more, and more intense, bushfires in the future.So how does our society ensure communications and businesses are able to function under that predicted regime?And how would our ultramodern business owners cope?COVID-19 has made cashless transactions a major part of daily life for all of us.But I don't see cash disappearing soon.And what will the kiddies do? No piggy bank to save up for treats or major items, to learn the reality of money, costs and effort to achieve goals.Gretchen Sleeman, San Isidore READ MORE LETTERS:Letters: Wagga City Council is in need of fresh faces Letters: Decision by some businesses to ban cash is bemusing Letters: Hydro electricity is an untapped resource CLIMATE LITIGATION ON THE RISE It's high time our government paid more attention to people like South Coast bushfire survivor Jo Dodds, who attended the COP26 climate summit as a representative of Bushfire Survivors For Climate Action (""Putting a human face on the climate crisis"", November 8).Frustrated with the lack of government action to reduce emissions, this group has recently taken legal proceedings.This year's IPPC report states that we need to take decisive steps to phase out pollutants in the next decade, if we are to keep global heating below dangerous levels.Yet our federal government continues to spend billions of taxpayers' dollars to subsidise the coal and gas industries.For the government to knowingly ignore the facts on climate change, is deliberate negligence.Is it any wonder that climate litigation is becoming more commonplace?Anne O'Hara, Wanniassa, ACT HAVE YOUR SAY: Do you have something to get off your chest?

This one action would do more to clean up the planet than anything else, and it is achievable. If COP26 had been for real, that is the one and only pledge they would have made. And they would have done it in a zoom meeting instead of a multi-day star-studded extravaganza. The majority of the people labelled ""climate change deniers"" would agree with this pledge. Ironically, the Apocalyptic Environmentalists in government, media, and groups like Green Peace will not agree, because it's an actual solution. We've all been very wicked, and we must be punished, according to their doctrine. For them, solutions like replacing coal with practical alternatives like natural gas and nuclear energy are not the point. It's all about the suffering. Realistic people understand that solar and wind power will never be the answer. The battery industry, when scaled up to equal the energy volumes of the fossil fuel industry, will be just as harmful to the planet. But I suppose this will suit the AE's, as once again we will have been very, very bad people.Kelvin DoerksenIf Canada could just get its natural gas to China it would reduce China's reliance on coal-fired electrical generation plants and possibly even prevent the construction of more of those coal plants which would go a long way to reaching GHG emission reduction goals.Choice is yours?This is an opinion I'm sure everyone can agree to. Every person has the right to choose. Unfortunately, certain people are taking that liberty to the extreme. Some people have allergies, and that is understandable, medicine is not a one size fits all cure. On the other hand, to those people that are choosing to not get vaccinated for religious, personal or ideological reasons and I say, that is your choice. Today I'm not here to chastise, I come with a simple solution to our pandemic problem. The biggest concern today is preventing the hospital system from becoming overwhelmed. A very serious concern. Since everyone wants to get back to normal life regardless of vax status, let's have the hospitals stop treating people choosing not to get vaccinated. We all know this won't happen because society, today's ""woke"" culture, won't let us leave anyone behind, but it truly does solve all our problems at once. Overcrowding at hospitals? Solved, 70% of current patients get sent home with Advil. Persuading people to get vaxxed? Seems like a better incentive than a lottery. It may seem somewhat heartless but what is worse, having people suffer because of a choice they made to not get vaxxed or having someone die from cancer because the space they need for surgery is occupied by someone who made a selfish choice? I leave the answer to each of you.John SmithYou're kidding yourself if you think everyone will agree with you.Oil for all?So the leader of the Bloc, FranÃ§ois Blanchet, thinks Alberta should pay even more into equalization. Why? Because he says they are not as ""green"" as Quebec because of ""dirty gas and oil."" They could green up in a flash. Just turn off the taps to Quebec and Ontario. Bingo!

520,Letters: Our national literature has long backed the cause of independence,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Herald Scotland,News,1551,,1551,Scotland,Letters,,,,Letters: Our national literature has long backed the cause of independence,"AS a lover of Scottish literature, Sheila Wallace (Letters, November 11) surely knows that the first major poem in the Scots tongue is Barbour\xE2s Brus, an epic celebration of Scotland\xE2s resistance to English aggression. From later periods, she is presumably acquainted with Robert Fergusson\xE2s The Ghaists, with its lines \xE2Black be the day that e\xE2er to England\xE2s ground, Scotland was eikit by the Union\xE2s bond!\xE2, and with Robert Burns\xE2s bitter diatribe against Scotland\xE2s loss of independence, \xE2Such a parcel of rogues in a nation\xE2.She should also be familiar with the fiery expressions of radical Scottish nationalism in Hugh MacDiarmid\xE2s poetry, and in that of the galaxy of superb Scots-writing poets whom his work inspired: Tom Scott, Sydney Goodsir Smith and Douglas Young, to mention only three of the greatest. I recall from distant student days a symposium in Glasgow University Union at which Norman MacCaig declared: \xE2Every poet in Scotland is a Scottish nationalist\xE2: other eminent figures of the literary scene were also present, and certainly none of them raised a dissenting voice. That was more than half a century ago; but I can think of precious few Scottish writers from that day to this who have not been overt supporters of independence.The association of our national literature with the cause of independence is not, as Sheila Wallace appears to think, a recent disreputable aberration, but a central fact of the entire field, particularly in the 20th and 21st centuries. Why else does she think generations of Scottish schoolchildren have been deliberately kept in ignorance of most of it?READ MORE:\xC2Why Scotland is the luckiest country in the worldDerrick McClure, Aberdeen.SCOTS MUSIC IS NOT NATIONALISTICCORRESPONDENCE from John Dunlop (November 9) and Sheila Wallace (November 11) describes alarm that Scottish music, poetry and literature is somehow spoiled and exploited by ""nationalists"".Our culture had been founded in a wild amalgamation of local and international influences. I play traditional music and the number of tunes that share Irish and Scottish roots is considerable.This music is not nationalistic, rather it is very local, with styles and repertoire changing from area to area. It is also international, shared by enthusiastic players across the globe.Allan McDougall, Neilston.TIME TO LOOK AT OUTSIDE FUNDINGOPPONENTS of self-government get worked up when celebrities have their tuppence worth, but far more insidious is people living outside Scotland spending large sums to secretly influence events in Scotland, normally by extreme right-wing organisations, and the Electoral Commission needs to clamp down on anonymous third-party funding in elections and referenda.For example, the recently published expenditure for May\xE2s Scottish elections included \xC256,256 by the anti-independence grouping Scotland Matters, who were bankrolled to the extent of \xC246,000 by the unknown Centre for Economic Education and Training, which only has a London PO Box address with no record of who is a member or who is funding it and did not register with the Electoral Commission. A further \xC219,000 donation to Scotland Matters was from a London-based former Tory researcher, so the vast bulk of its funding was from outside Scotland.The same applies to the new Scotland Office minister, and Lords peer, Malcolm Offord\xE2s so-called grass roots London-based No Borders organisation that spent \xC2150,000 during the 2014 referendum campaign and received \xC250,000 from Stalbury Trustees, which is based in England and whose stated company objects is \xE2the promotion of the Conservative Party\xE2.Fraser Grant, Edinburgh.IN SEARCH OF COMPROMISEWILLIE Maclean (Letters, November 11) is quite mistaken to describe my position on a second referendum as being that future voters \xE2should never have the opportunity to cast a vote on the independence question\xE2.On the contrary, as regular readers know, I have consistently argued for a New Act of Union that provides a unilateral route to secession, subject to a referendum based on best practice elsewhere (which may include supermajorities and double majorities). This is my reasonable suggestion for a compromise which respects the outcome of 2014 vote and would ensure that independence would only happen if it was the settled will of a clear majority.However, the concepts of \xE2reasonable\xE2 and \xE2compromise\xE2 are unrecognisable to the nationalist mindset.Peter A Russell, Glasgow.LITTLE HAS CHANGED SINCE 2014THE SNP has never really got over its defeat in the 2014 referendum.It is certainly worth noting that in the most recent Holyrood elections the number of votes cast for the SNP amounted to 2,385,788, whilst the Conservative/Labour/Liberal Democrat voters added up to 2,624,825. In percentage terms this is roughly a ratio of 47.6 / 52.4, which is very close to the results in the independence referendum. So one can only conclude that nothing really much has changed \xE2 the majority of Scots still wish to remain in the UK.The recent agreement on the part of the SNP to come to a deal with the largely unelected Scottish Greens merely leads to a greater impasse, rather than any political advantage.One could well suggest that this is just another attempt to by the SNP to try to undermine the sound economy and political leadership of these islands. Scotland's future will be far safer politically, and economically, if it continues as a constituent part of the UK.Robert IG Scott, Ceres, Fife.A BARON ARGUMENTDR Angus Macmillan (Letters, November 11) refers to the fact that the Labour Party has colluded with the system associated with appointments to the House of Lords for years. Who once said ""The House of Lords must go \xE2 not be reformed, not be replaced, not be reborn in some nominated life after-death patronage paradise, just closed down, abolished, finished""? Answer: Neil Kinnock in 1976 .What is he today? Answer: Baron Kinnock of Bedwellty.That just about says it all.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.EUROPE AGAINST NUCLEAR WEAPONSRETIRED Irish Defence Force Colonel Dorcha Lee writes that \xE2Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey are storing US nuclear weapons, without any public concern\xE2 (""Would an independent Scotland be vulnerable? Not necessarily"", The Herald, November 11). Polling by ICAN, the international campaign to abolish nuclear weapons, in four of the five countries Col Lee references, suggests otherwise.The publics in these four countries were asked if the US tactical nuclear weapons should be removed and responded in the affirmative as follows: Belgium 57%, The Netherlands 58%, Italy 74% and Germany 83%. Figures for Turkey are not available.These polls reveal that anti-nuclear sentiment, particularly amongst the original Western European members of Nato is considerable. It is another sign of Scotland\xE2s Western European political cultural alignment in general and that Scottish anti-nuclear sentiment is not some sort of outlier. It is Brexit Britain that is the real outlier.At its August conference the SNP passed a motion by more than 500 votes to 14 endorsing the earlier decision of all SNP parliamentarians to sign the ICAN parliamentary pledge that an independent Scotland would swiftly sign the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) which came into force at the UN in January 2021.The TPNW has 86 state signatories and so far 56 states have ratified it, a number that will grow by the time the TPNW has its CoP1 hosted by the Austrian Government in Vienna in March next year, an event that many of us in the civil society dimension of the anti-nuclear movement hope to attend.Bill Ramsay, Convener, SNP CND, Glasgow.A GOOD COP FOR FIRST MINISTERI ALWAYS enjoy Alison Rowat's rapier-sharp wit, but if ""Mr B Johnson of London"" has indeed left the comment she imagines, that Glasgow is a ""fab bolthole if up to neck in sleaze row"", Mr Johnson, with sleaze now over his head, will find it well-nigh impossible to rise above it, whether in Glasgow or anywhere else (""Just for a while, the world really did belong to Glasgow"", The Herald, November 11). And although he'd ditched the plane on his return to the climate conference, his arrival as he alighted from the train was greeted with less than enthusiasm from the reception committee; it wasn't just the gap Boris Johnson had to mind.However, even more of an irritant to Mr Johnson must be the high profile Scotland's First Minister has achieved at the conference. Mr Johnson infamously told the Scottish Tories he didn't want Nicola Sturgeon ""anywhere near it"", although he had to do a U-turn on that, given that Nicola Sturgeon is First Minister of the country where the conference is taking place. Then there was the Tory MP alleging that the three objectives at COP26 were ""Save the planet. Save the country. And stop Sturgeon getting a photo with Biden"". That one didn't go well for Mr Johnson either.As for the overall verdict on the conference, Ms Rowat is right to sum it up as ""jury out"". But whether it has been a good COP, a bad COP, or a Cop-out, only time will tell.

Millions more joined a day of action in cities around the globe, including Belfast and Dublin.Rev Cheryl, who is a chaplain at UIster University as well as chaplain to the mayor of Lisburn and Hillsborough, travelled to Glasgow as part of a five-strong delegation of Christian Aid Ireland activists. Stephen Trew, a civil servant and climate activist from Lurgan; Helen Newell, a Christian Aid Ireland staff member who lives in Belfast; Dr Jeni McAughey, a retired GP and environmental activist from Whitehead; and Darren Vermaak who works for a clinical research company and lives in Dublin, joined Cheryl in Glasgow.Included with their luggage were thousands of origami paper boats which joined a Christian Aid ‘flotilla’ of thousands of ‘little boats’ displayed in a Glasgow cathedral to coincide with the crucial summit. Over recent weeks, Christian Aid supporters have been folding pieces of paper into the shape of a boat, inside which they wrote their hopes and prayers for the world’s last-ditch effort to avert runaway climate change.The paper boats symbolise that although we are all in the same storm, we aren’t in the same boat when it comes to dealing with the impact of climate change. Richer, polluting countries like the UK and Ireland are well-placed to cope with its effects while people in developing countries, where emissions are low, are already experiencing intense heatwaves, prolonged drought, dangerous cyclones, calamitous flooding and devastating locust swarms. In the countries where Christian Aid works, climate change is a powerful driver of poverty which has for many years been destroying crops, homes and livelihoods. Christian Aid urged negotiators to: Increase financial support to the world’s poorest countries to confront the climate crisis; Take action to reduce carbon emissions in order to limit the rise in average global temperatures to 1.5C; Stop the expansion of fossil fuel energy and invest in clean energy.Christian Aid Ireland Chief Executive Rosamond Bennett thanked Rev Cheryl and the others for taking the time to travel to Glasgow to show their support for people in developing countries. She said: “Stirred by climate activists and young people, concerned citizens and faith communities are coming together to demand real, immediate and lasting action to avert a climate catastrophe. When they met in Glasgow, world leaders heard the voices of these five individuals and millions more like them. The seas are rising but so are we.”",Copyright 2021 JPIMedia Publishing Ltd All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|CHRISTIAN AID|CHRISTIANS & CHRISTIANITYCLERGY & RELIGIOUS VOCATIONSCLIMATOLOGYPROTESTANTS & PROTESTANTISMCLIMATE CHANGEEMISSIONSNEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSDEVELOPING COUNTRIESENERGY & ENVIRONMENTENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCESENVIRONMENTALISMGREEN FINANCEPOLLUTION & ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTSCITIESEXTREME TEMPERATURESHEAT WAVESNEGATIVE NEWSNEGATIVE SOCIETAL NEWSPROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONSUNITED NATIONSVULNERABLE ADULTSEXECUTIVESGLOBAL WARMINGGREENHOUSE GASESENVIRONMENTAL ACCIDENTS & DISASTERSPOVERTY & HOMELESSNESS|EMISSIONSENERGY & UTILITIESALTERNATIVE & RENEWABLE ENERGYENERGY & ENVIRONMENTGREEN FINANCEPUBLISHINGGLOBAL WARMING|DUBLIN, IRELANDGLASGOW, SCOTLANDBELFAST, NORTHERN IRELAND|IRELANDUNITED KINGDOMSCOTLAND",

Former First Sea Lord, Admiral Lord West, said her presence would mean a huge amount to serving personnel and veterans. He added: ""She has an incredible sense of duty, is colonel of a number of regiments and takes all of her liaisons with the military very seriously.""She feels the loss of the brave men and women who have fought for our country.""A Palace spokesman confirmed the Cenotaph return, adding: ""As in previous years, Her Majesty will view the service from the balcony of the Foreign, Commonwealth andDevelopment Office building.""Mindful of her doctors' recent advice, the Queen has decided not to attend the General Synod Service and Opening Session on Tuesday November 16. The Earl of Wessex will attend as planned.""It is thought Her Majesty will miss the Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall tomorrow.But news of Sunday's return came hours after Prince Charles reassured wellwishers about the Queen's health.

525,Malaysiaâ€™s carbon challenge,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,New Straits Times (Malaysia),News,596,NS12;Pg. 2,596,Malaysia,,,,,Malaysiaâ€™s carbon challenge,"MALAYSIA, like other nations concerned about global warming, has a net zero ambition. Its carbon neutrality target is 2050. But the path there is not going to be a walk in the park. Not because Malaysia started late. In some things, Malaysia is an early riser. Like in flattening the Earth-warming curve. Perhaps this is why Malaysia isnâ€™t one of the 19 countries in the Asia-Pacific region which havenâ€™t submitted its Nationally Determined Contribution to COP26. But having started rather early in 2009 (long before the Paris Accords were signed, it must be said), it lost its agility along the way. Blame it on Malaysiaâ€™s energy-centric economy. But Putrajaya appears to be getting serious. If the EAC Dialogue on Tuesday is any signal, the government is preparing the economy for the climate challenge. What with extreme weather events wreaking havoc from Kangar to Kinabatangan. The government is saying â€œnoâ€ to new coal-fired power plants. Putrajaya is also said to be working on carbon reduction measures and low-carbon development strategies. Next year should see these implemented, if intent is turned into action.KPMGâ€™s inaugural Net Zero Readiness Index (NZRI), released on Oct 14, scores the intent and some action. Out of 32 countries, Malaysia emerged 22nd. Not a bad score for a country fuelled by an energy-centric economy. But the country has miles to go before it puts carbon emissions to sleep. Malaysiaâ€™s electricity- and heat-generating sector, by the reckoning of NZRI, contributes 34 per cent to emissions. This is not surprising as the country uses coal and gas to generate electricity. As it is, Malaysiaâ€™s installed capacity of coal-powered plants is a worrying 40 per cent of the total capacity. Malaysiaâ€™s challenge will be how to decarbonise its energy-centric economy in the face of population growth pressures and poverty outside of urban areas, NZRI quotes Phang Oy Cheng, executive director of Sustainability Advisory, KPMG Malaysia, as saying. He continues: â€œThe transition to net zero will require not just political will but also significant structural and legislative reforms on a national scale. â€ Nations among the top 10 of NZRI seemed to have turned net zero ambitions into commitments by adopting such reforms in a whole-of-nation approach.Malaysia must do the same. Among the players in Malaysiaâ€™s economy, the financial sector appears to be doing some commendable things. Bank Negara Malaysia, the countryâ€™s central bank, is one such player helping to set the pace of the sector. Its Climate Change and Principles-based Taxonomy (CCPT) is one such pace-setter. The CCPT does several things, but its principal role is to help financial institutions push the transition to a low-carbon economy. Therein lies the limitation of CCPT and instruments like it to decarbonise the world. Finance companies do not directly cause emissions. So the net-zero pledges by banks may not save Malaysia. What will save the country are the pledges and commitments of companies. Petronas, Malaysiaâ€™s oil and gas producer, has taken the lead by saying it will go net zero in 2050. But Malaysiaâ€™s economy isnâ€™t driven by giants alone. The non-giants, otherwise known as small- and medium-scale enterprises, make up the bulk of the economy. In KPMGâ€™s calculation, these enterprises produce three-quarters of Malaysiaâ€™s industrial output. These must decarbonise. Being â€œsmallâ€ and â€œmediumâ€, they will need government show-how. Money and technology-transfer would help, too. Ambition always does well with action.( END )",Copyright 2021 New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad All Rights Reserved,,Newspaper|ENGLISH|Main Section|CARBON NEUTRAL INITIATIVESGLOBAL WARMINGEMISSIONSLOW CARBON ECONOMYSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTCARBON NEUTRAL ENERGYCLIMATE CHANGEGREEN ECONOMYGREENHOUSE GASESSEVERE WEATHERWEATHERCOMPANY STRATEGYELECTRICITY GENERATING CAPACITYGOVERNMENT PROCEDURE & LAWMAKINGNEGATIVE NEWSBANKING & FINANCE SECTOR PERFORMANCEONTOLOGIES & TAXONOMIESPOPULATION GROWTH|CARBON NEUTRAL INITIATIVESENERGY & UTILITIESGLOBAL WARMINGBANKING & FINANCECOAL FIRED PLANTSEMISSIONSFOSSIL FUEL POWER PLANTSLOW CARBON ECONOMYSUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENTELECTRIC POWER PLANTSCARBON NEUTRAL ENERGYGREEN ECONOMYUTILITIES INDUSTRYELECTRICITY GENERATING CAPACITYBANKING & FINANCE SECTOR PERFORMANCEBANKING & FINANCE REGULATION & POLICY|EARTH|MALAYSIAASIA,

This is the first winter since the pandemic started we've had no Covid restrictions.But, with cases rising, the government have made the wrong call by ignoring advice on enforcing mask use.It's not too much to ask wearing a face covering on public transport, or in a supermarket or in a theatre.Covid hasn't suddenly disappeared from the face of the Earth as current rising infection rates proves.It was outrageous a maskless Boris Johnson was seated right next to 95-year-old Sir David Attenborough at the recent COP26 conference in Glasgow.This was his way of saying that Britain has beaten Covid into submission and restrictions are no longer necessary.The truth is the government is only interested in making money.As for saving lives,that comes a very distant second.STEPHEN DIXON, RedcarI HAVE just watched a news programme where the usual petty people said nothing at all about Prince Charles not wearing a mask indoors, then jumped all over Boris for not wearing a mask indoors.I was at the last Boro home match and was the only person wearing a mask on the concourse.

It is also a diplomatic coup for China, which has been recognised by Washington as a world power worthy of bilateral engagement.Beijing has previously attempted to join co-operation on climate change with the US to a much broader suite of grievances, including its support for Taiwan.However, China and the US have now declared they will work ""individually, jointly, and with other countries during this decisive decade, in accordance with different national circumstances, to stren-gthen and accelerate climate -action and co-operation"".On its side, the US has set a goal to reach 100 per cent carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035.And for its part, China has said it will phase down coal consumption during the 15th Five Year Plan and make its best efforts to accelerate this work. China is building new coal-fired power stations at home but has said it will stop funding unabated power stations overseas.The US and China will co-operate on carbon capture and storage or reuse and direct air capture.Most significantly for Australia, China has agreed to work with the US to limit emissions of methane - although it did not sign the pledge championed by the Biden administration to cut methane emissions by 30 per cent this decade. Rather, China ""intends to develop a comprehensive and ambitious national action plan on methane, aiming to achieve a significant effect on methane emissions control and reductions"".Both sides intend to convene a meeting in the first half of 2022 to focus on the specifics of enhancing measurement and mitigation of methane, including through standards to reduce methane from the fossil and waste sectors, as well as incentives and programs to reduce methane from the farming sector. As a result, Australia will come under sustained pressure to join the push to phase down methane emissions.

531,Migration and Experimentation: What Led to Australia’s Coffee Culture;Letter 233,"November 12, 2021 Friday",New York,The New York Times,News,978,WORLD;australia,978,,Yan Zhuang,,,,Migration and Experimentation: What Led to Australia’s Coffee CultureLetter 233,"When Italian migrants arrived after World War II, they helped develop a coffee scene that many now regard as the best in the world.The Australia Letter is a weekly newsletter from our Australia bureau. Sign up to get it by email.A couple of years ago, when I was planning a trip to the United States, a few friends joked that I had to beware of their terrible coffee.As someone who’d grown used to the standards set by Melbourne cafes, I remember thinking: It can’t that bad, right? I mean sure, it might be a little substandard, but you can’t mess up a flat white too much.Then I got there, had a sip of the brewed brown swill they like to drink and realized that it was really that bad.Australian coffee has become something of a global phenomenon, most recently evidenced by the flat whites our delegation gave out at the COP26 meeting and which reportedly were a resounding success. (Unlike the rest of Australia’s performance at the climate summit).Over the last decade or two, Aussie-run cafes have popped up around the world. Our coffee is slowly being embraced by Americans. In 2015, Starbucks started selling “Australian style” flat whites, reigniting a fierce debate about whether it originated in Australia or New Zealand.Our coffee culture, particularly in places like Melbourne, is world-class. The story of how it developed speaks to both our immigrant past and our willingness to go at things our own way instead of following tradition.According to historians, it started after World War II, when Italian migrants brought with them espresso machines and the European cafe culture.“The introduction of espresso coffee in the 1950s is nostalgically remembered by many as a key watershed between a drab past and a cosmopolitan present,” Andrew May, a historian at the University of Melbourne, said via email.But it wasn’t quick to take off, he added. “There was also still a lot of racism toward Italian migrants. So it was a slow burn really, and the next wave of inner-city rejuvenation and gentrification from the early 1980s — a new wave of Bohemian cafes — gave coffee another significant boost.”Our love for velvety, milky coffee came from the marriage of Italian espresso and the existing British tradition of drinking tea and instant coffee with milk. “We’ve perfected the milk side of coffee because we’re a milk drinking nation,” said Bruno Maiolo, the president of the Australian Specialty Coffee Association.And how did Australian coffee go to the next level? It’s because baristas and roasters have been willing to push the boundaries, always experimenting and refining, he said. “We’re new and young and hip and always asking questions about every piece of the puzzle.”This willingness to mix-and-match and experiment is a running theme in Australian food culture, said Emma Felton, a sociologist from the Queensland University of Technology.“You look at countries like France or any European country and they’re much more hidebound. Their culture is much more rigid, so they don’t have as much experimentation, with their food in particular.”“We don’t have to conform so much because we’re a nation of immigrants,” she said. “We really pick-and-grab from all over the world.”At home, Australians don’t think of ourselves as a nation of coffee connoisseurs, she added, but we usually are by default, because of the high standard we are accustomed to.Do you have anything you took for granted in Australia until you saw how other countries did it?

But worse was to come.There had been a dreadful road accident the night before; a car full of teenagers had ploughed into another vehicle in rural Perthshire, causing numerous fatalities.My TV newsdesk dispatched me that Sunday morning to cover the aftermath. Experience had taught me that in quiet villages, the newsagent was the focal point.Gilet got out of his 4x4, and as he did so I introduced myself, microphone in hand and cameraman by my side, and asked if he\xE2d like to comment for the evening news.\xE2You people are scum, you\xE2re vultures,\xE2 he replied. \xE2You are intruding on grief for your exaggerated headlines. Why don\xE2t you just eff off? Journalists are the lowest form of humanity.\xE2He disappeared into the shop and returned a few minutes later carrying the biggest bundle of newspapers you will ever see.READ MORE: Opinion - 'Tragedy on film set shows need for utmost care'That\xE2s the kind of viewpoint people often spit out when asked their opinion of the press, and of the media in general.Many will base that viewpoint on the shameful News of the World phone hacking scandal of a decade ago, which is fair enough. But remember, it was journalists who uncovered Watergate, Thalidomide, the \xE2cash for questions\xE2 and MPs\xE2 expenses scandals and who found Ronnie Biggs in Brazil, to name but a very few.Press reporters, of course, plough the political furrow of their newspapers, but broadcasters don\xE2t, because of a little thing called OFCOM rules.It always makes me laugh when I hear it said that so and so is pro-union or pro-independence, pro-Rangers or pro-Celtic.Generally it\xE2s the case that if everybody is angry with journalists, then they must be doing something right.Never once in 40 years as a journalist in newspapers, radio and television was I ordered to spin a story politically. The news agenda generally sets itself and news stories tend to write themselves anyway.I am more than happy with how our journalists hold to account those who require it, particularly the current breed of politicians \xE2 some of whom display a staggering paucity of principles.We need to cherish journalists with the guts and freedom to call out those who need it.And after a lifetime of watching, listening and reading, and too many decades spent writing, I remember two things.First, just because you don\xE2t agree with something you see or hear in the media, doesn\xE2t mean it\xE2s wrong.And second, if you don\xE2t like the press and media in this country, then pop across to North Korea and see if you like how the system works there.READ MORE: Opinion - 'COP26 simply has to succeed for all our futures'",Copyright 2021 NewsQuest Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|TRAFFIC ACCIDENTSTRAFFIC FATALITIESJOURNALISMWRITERSDEATH & DYINGPOLITICAL SCANDALSSCANDALSNEWS CORP PHONE HACKING SCANDALPHONE HACKING|TRAFFIC ACCIDENTSTRAFFIC FATALITIESWRITERSPRIMETIME TELEVISIONMEDIA & TELECOMMUNICATIONSNEWSSTANDSNEWS CORP PHONE HACKING SCANDALPHONE HACKING|BRAZILKOREA, DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF",
533,Ministers could look again at consumption room plans,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Evening Times (Glasgow),News,538,Pg. 4,538,Scotland,Stacey Mullen ,,,,Ministers could look again at consumption room plans,"SNP ministers are ""actively exploring"" new proposals for drug consumption rooms after Scotland's top law officer appeared to open the door to their introduction.Dorothy Bain QC, who was appointed Lord Advocate earlier this year, said ""the question of what is in the public interest"" could be looked at again.Drug consumption rooms allow users to take substances such as heroin under medical supervision and with access to clean equipment and support services.Supporters argue they could help tackle Scotland's appalling drug-related death rate.There were 1,339 drug deaths in Scotland last year, a new record and by far the highest rate recorded by any country in Europe.The previous Lord Advocate, James Wolffe QC, was asked about drug consumption rooms by Glasgow City Health and Social Care Partnership in 2017.It wanted assurances that the health board, council, staff and partner organisations would not face prosecution if such a facility was set up.Mr Wolffe concluded it wasn't possible to grant this request.However, giving evidence to Holyrood's Criminal Justice Committee, Ms Bain said it was ""important to see the distinction between what James Wolffe was asked and what could be asked"". She added: ""So the question of what is in the public interest would be something that could be looked at again.""But it would have to be looked at again in very careful circumstances, where a very detailed set of proposals are brought and we're confident that they are based on sound evidence.""Ms Bain told MSPs a ""precise, detailed, specific"" proposal ""underpinned by evidence"" and which had support ""would require a fresh consideration by me as Lord Advocate"".She referenced the ""undoubted crisis that we face in relation to the number of drug deaths in Scotland"". Scottish Labour MSP Claire Baker asked Deputy First Minister John Swinney about the comments in Holyrood. Filling in for Nicola Sturgeon, who is at COP26 in Glasgow, Mr Swinney said: ""The Lord Advocate's statement confirms a new opportunity for new proposals to be considered regarding safer drug consumption facilities. ""We've been clear on the benefits that safer drug consumption facilities would bring to reducing drug-related deaths in Scotland, and we are actively exploring how we can overcome the existing legal barriers that will allow us to progress the use of these facilities.""He said the Scottish Government sees drug abuse as a ""public health issue"". Ms Baker sought assurances that the Government's proposal will be ""robust"" and asked for a timescale for a new scheme to be brought forward.Mr Swinney said the Government ""is taking forward active discussions to establish what could be an acceptable route to enable the appropriate use of drug consumption rooms as part of the public health strategy to tackle the drugs problems that we face in Scottish society"". He said this involves ""a great deal of dialogue"" with Police Scotland, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and the Crown Office, among others.  He added: ""That work is underway. As for a timescale, if Claire Baker will forgive me, I can't give a definitive timescale today. ""But I do assure her that that is being actively pursued as a consequence of the remarks made by the Lord Advocate.""",Copyright 2021 Newsquest Media Group All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ETI|ENGLISH|APPOINTMENTSDEATH RATESNEGATIVE NEWSPUBLIC HEALTHSCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTYCRIMINAL LAWHEALTH DEPARTMENTSNARCOTICSSOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE & LIFESTYLEDEATH & DYINGASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONSEVIDENCEHEROINSUBSTANCE ABUSEUK LABOUR PARTYWITNESSESMEDICINE & HEALTHCRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT & CORRECTIONS|HEALTH DEPARTMENTSNARCOTICSHEROIN|NICOLA STURGEON|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|SCOTLANDEUROPE",
534,Moe's ploy to make Saskatchewan a nation;OPINION,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Globe and Mail (Canada),News,755,NEWS;Pg. A17,755,Canada,GARY MASON,,SASKATCHEWAN ROUGHRIDERS,SASKATCHEWAN ROUGHRIDERS,Moe's ploy to make Saskatchewan a nationOPINION,"LeadThat rumbling sound you heard this week was the very foundation of the country being shaken by calls from Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe for nationhood status within Confederation.And the populace responded with a collective: say what?Well, slough off this threat at your peril, my friends. Saskatchewan may not have been one of the three founding nations of Canada. And it doesn't have a language separate from the rest of the country. But people were surely curling there long before it became fashionable in the rest of the country.Texte/TextAnd if being a fan of the Saskatchewan Roughriders doesn't make you unique, what does?And then there's bunny hugs. If you have to ask then clearly you haven't been to the province. I could go on. Well, actually I couldn't. But surely there's enough there to make the case that Saskatchewan is as culturally distinct as one of its delicious berry pies.This week on the Roy Green radio show, Mr. Moe made this very case, suggesting his province deserved to have special status within Confederation because, well, it deserved it. Now one could take this statement seriously or recognize it for what it is: preposterous pandering to a party base that hasn't exactly been thrilled with the Premier's performance of late.It's Mr. Moe creating yet another distraction from his government's gross mishandling of the fourth wave of the pandemic.And the way you deal with that is you talk about ""independence"" instead.""We're going to flex our autonomy,"" Mr. Moe told Mr. Green's radio audience. ""Flex our provincial muscle, if you will, within the nation of Canada.""Go ahead and flex, Mr. Premier.Mr. Moe said he wasn't proposing separation (phew!), but rather greater autonomy from a federal government that is working ""against the best interests of the country.""If the Premier honestly believes his province will be further ahead with its own police force, taxation regime, immigration program, then start the talks. If being more like Quebec is what Saskatchewan - with 3 per cent of the country's population - wants, then let the negotiations begin.My strong suspicion is this is not a priority for most of the good folks who live there. Rather, it's a means for Mr. Moe to take a few cheap whacks at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, which is always good politics in a part of the Prairies where that last name can still incite red faces and strong language.Mr. Moe said he is upset with the federal government's plan to cap oil and gas emissions as part of its commitment to reducing the country's CO2 output by 40 per cent by 2030. Although, he admitted to a recent party convention, he wasn't sure what impact, if any, this policy would have on the province.The Premier lamented the fact that Mr. Trudeau didn't go to the COP26 conference in Glasgow and tout the benefits of Saskatchewan energy, which he said was the most sustainable anywhere on the planet. This would be news to environmentalists who have long lamented the province's environmental record.Methane leakage from gas wells in Saskatchewan has been a huge problem for ages, yet the gas helps generate more than 40 per cent of the province's electricity. Another 40 per cent is produced using coal. I'm not sure Mr. Moe wants anyone going to international conferences singing the praises of Saskatchewan's environmental record because this fantasy would be exposed in a hurry.The fact is, what Mr. Moe and his BFF next door, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney, specialize in these days is corrosive and divisive grievance politics. Everything is the fault of the big, bad Liberal government in Ottawa that is allegedly singling out the two provinces through its energy plan and other policies.Mr. Trudeau would never implement something like a cap on oil and gas emissions against Ontario's car manufacturing sector, they complain. No, the Liberals would just impose a carbon tax that will soar to $170 a tonne by the end of the decade instead - a levy that is partly designed to get people out of their cars. The same Liberals that also plan to bring in a zero-emission mandate for new vehicles.Mr. Moe's ""nation within a nation"" gambit this week is embarrassing. As I say, it's a nonsensical ploy to get people to look somewhere other than at his government's dismal handling of the pandemic.The Premier's complaint of regional bias against Saskatchewan and the West by the federal government became boring a long time ago. If he thinks wanting to be like Quebec is the answer to all that ails his province, he's sadly mistaken.",Copyright 2021 All material copyright The Globe and Mail or its licensors.

This could see nursing staff refusing to work overtime, starting and finishing shifts on time and taking all their breaks.A formal strike ballot would be required before action could be sanctioned but the RCN said the results of the indicative ballot ""demonstrates how difficult things are within the NHS"".Mr Swinney, who was standing in forMs Sturgeon at Holyrood while she continued to attend the Cop26 summit in Glasgow, apologised to Mr Brown's family but cited the extra funding and staffing for the ambulance service that has already been announced.Ms Sturgeon called in the British Army in September to help drive ambulances after a pensioner died during a 40-hour wait for help.Douglas Ross, the Scottish Tory leader, said: ""Scotland's NHS is crying out for help. It cannot be left waiting. Front-line staff have sent out their own 999 call to the government.""Our health service needs a firm commitment of more cash to tackle this crisis, not John Swinney's weak excuses.""He said the UK Government had handed the SNP-Green coalition an extra £605million that was ""waiting to be used"".Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, said: ""Mr Brown isn't the first avoidable death this winter, and if action isn't taken, he will not be the last.""People are dying not because we don't have the treatments to help them, but because help isn't coming fast enough.""He said the NHS was struggling ""long before Covid"", pointing out the Royal College of Nursing had reported record staff shortages and consultants have warned that hospitals need an extra thousand beds.Alex Cole-Hamilton, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, disclosed figures obtained using the Freedom of Information Act showing a 300 per cent rise in ambulance staff absences from work thanks to mental health problems.Mr Swinney repeatedly emphasised the ""significant impact"" Covid has had on the NHS. He said 179 new staff had joined the service, a figure that will rise to 356 by the spring, but he was trou bled by the Unite survey as: ""I want staff to feel valued.""'People are dying not because we don't have the treatments, but because help isn't coming fast enough'",Copyright 2021 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|DTL|ENGLISH|Scotland|AMBULANCE & RESCUE SERVICESDEATH & DYINGLABOR UNIONSPOLITICAL PARTIESSCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTYNATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCESTRIKESNEGATIVE NEWSNURSES & NURSINGUK CONSERVATIVE PARTYUK LABOUR PARTYUK LIBERAL DEMOCRATSUK POLITICAL PARTIESNEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWSOVERTIMEPOLLS & SURVEYSINVESTIGATIONSARMIES|AMBULANCE & RESCUE SERVICESEMERGENCY VEHICLESNATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCENURSES & NURSINGMEDIA & TELECOMMUNICATIONSARMIES|NICOLA STURGEON|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|SCOTLANDUNITED KINGDOM",

Even a short weekend out of town can satiate that need to escape, and the Canadian Rockies are stunning in the fall. Here are a few spots you may not have considered, places off the beaten path.MOMENT IN TIME: NOVEMBER 10, 1871Henry Morton Stanley meets British explorer Dr. David LivingstoneHenry Morton Stanley, a 30-year-old journalist with the New York Herald newspaper, set out from Zanzibar in March, 1871, with nothing more than a large expense account, 100 porters, mules, horses, ample gear and a simple mission: find the missing missionary and explorer, David Livingstone. Eight months and 1,100 kilometres later, after Stanley's caravan had hacked its way through the heart of the African continent, escaped tribal-colonial skirmishes and crocodiles - and Stanley himself lost 40 pounds, survived smallpox, dysentery and malaria - the moment came. It was on this day in 1871 in Ujiji, a small village near Lake Tanganyika in present-day Tanzania, when Stanley saw a sickly European man with white hair and a bushy beard. He was sitting on a straw mat. Stanley approached him, doffed his helmet and extended his hand. ""Dr. Livingstone, I presume."" To which Livingstone, of whom nothing had been heard for several years after his failed mission to find the source of the Nile, replied, ""Yes."" However, it is possible the braggadocious reporter fabricated his now-famous four-word greeting. Stanley said he recounted the conversation verbatim in his journal, except those pages had mysteriously been torn out and never found. Philip KingRead today's horoscopes.

This can help alleviate the job losses identified elsewhere.""He added that thousands of giant offshore wind turbines are needed to meet climate change targets, which will need 30,000 steel fabrication jobs every year and 20 million tonnes of steel.Unite assistant general secretary Steve Turner said: ""The necessary transition to a new green economy must put workers and communities at its heart.""Working people will only be won over when they're confident that no workplace or community will be left behind on our journey.""We need and deserve so much more than sound bites and rhetoric, we will not buy a pig in a poke.""The Government has no industrial plan or strategy to reassure UK workers or this union that a 'green' transition will be either fair or just.""A Government spokesperson said: ""We do not accept this analysis. We are levelling up in every part of the United Kingdom, spreading opportunity, empowering local leaders, improving public services and regenerating our town centres and high streets.""As we move to a green economy and deliver net zero, new jobs are being created - 56,000 just this year - and we're building on that through a £200 million boost to communities by providing skills training for the unemployed and investment in businesses developing low-carbon technology.""The forthcoming Levelling Up White Paper will set out how we will further improve opportunity and boost livelihoods across the country as we recover from the pandemic.""

Was it December, after I carried a Christmas tree up two flights of stairs? Or did it begin in April, when Tottenham  sacked Jose Mourinho  and appointed Ryan Mason  - two years my junior - as interim head coach?It was bad enough when Theo Walcott  - only weeks older than me - made the England squad for the 2006 World Cup, a time when I was still struggling to get invited to parties. But to be older than a Premier League manager - who am I, my dad?I was reminded of this with the news of Steven Gerrard 's appointment at Aston Villa and rumours of Frank Lampard at Norwich. To me, they will always be players. So if they're getting older, I must be as well.Football , like any obsession, provides texture and context to life. Seasons exist not merely to hand out prizes, but to help me recall where I was living, who I was dating, and what I was thinking. To be honest, when Twain said history rhymes, I think he meant Arsenal losing at Bolton.Football brings order to the chaos. It kicks off in August with the Community Shield, which for legal reasons must be referred to as the ""traditional curtain-raiser"". The FA Cup third-round falls on the first Saturday of January and it's all over by May.It plays the same role between years. When was my bar mitzvah party? Easy, May 12, 2002 at Highbury, where the Arsenal team were celebrating their league and cup double with an open-top bus parade. By way of an apology for the inconvenience, Patrick Vieira kissed my mum (on the cheek).The funny thing is, it works even for events that took place long before my time. When did Britain adopt decimalisation? That's obvious, 1971, the year Arsenal won their first double.If Gerrard or Lampard go on to have managerial careers even half as good as their playing days, fans born today may not care if they played at all, let alone be forced to have an opinion on whether the two could operate in central midfield together.That would be the real joy of being a kid again.

JaraGov’t breaks ground on Manila subway’s Camp Aguinaldo StationTHE DEPARTMENT of Transportation and the Department of National Defense on Thursday broke ground on the Metro Manila Subway Project’s Camp Aguinaldo Station.Pre-construction works prior to the main construction of the Camp Aguinaldo Station include the “replication works of affected living quarters and medical gas storage, and rehabilitation of [a] warehouse,” the Transportation department said in a statement.The project is a 36-kilometer rail line that is expected to reduce travel time between Quezon City and the Ninoy Aquino International Airport from one hour and 30 minutes to just 30 minutes.The Transportation department has said the Metro Manila Subway Project is expected to start excavation activities in the first quarter of 2022.The government broke ground on the first three stations in Feb. 2019 after the Transportation department signed a P51-billion deal with the Shimizu joint venture, which consists of Shimizu Corp., Fujita Corp., Takenaka Civil Engineering Co. Ltd., and EEI Corp.While the public will have to wait until 2025 for full operations of the 17-station subway, the government is planning to launch partial operations, covering the first three stations by 2022. — Arjay L. BalinbinNATIONWIDE ROUND-UPSupreme Court orders AMLC to disclose bank records in 2009 chopper purchase caseTHE SUPREME Court has affirmed the anti-graft tribunal’s order for the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) to disclose bank records related to the Philippine National Police’s procurement of secondhand choppers in 2009.The case involves former first gentleman Jose Miguel T. Arroyo, who was charged with plunder for his involvement in the PNP’s purchase of helicopters that he allegedly owned.The High Court said that it dismissed AMLC’s motions asking it to void and review the Sandiganbayan’s subpoena compelling the anti-money laundering council to disclose its records of Lionair, Inc. (Lionair), which sold the helicopters as brand new even if they were already used.“In sum, there was no showing that the Sandiganbayan gravely abused its discretion in issuing the Subpoena Duces Tecum and Ad Testificandum and denying petitioner’s Motion to Quash and Motion for Reconsideration,” the court said in a press release on Thursday.“Instead of avoiding compliance with the Subpoena, petitioner must firmly perform its mandate as an investigatory body and independent financial intelligence unit,” the Supreme Court said.The high tribunal said the AMLC had argued that whatever information it has on Lionair’s bank account is confidential under Republic Act No. 9160, or the Anti-Money Laundering Act.However, the Sandiganbayan denied the AMLC’s motions, ruling that its misgivings on the disclosure of the bank records were outweighed by the importance of the documents.“The High Court found the AMLC’s argument untenable,” it said.The Supreme Court further said that based on RA 9160, the AMLC “is not one of the covered institutions prohibited from disclosing information on covered and suspicious transactions.”The rationale behind the prohibition does not apply to the AMLC, it added.The Court said that “the criminal prosecution of anti-money laundering offenses would be unduly hampered if petitioners were prohibited from disclosing information regarding covered and suspicious transactions.”In a July 11, 2011 press release from the Department of Interior and Local Government, which has jurisdiction over the police, it said that based on documents, “the two choppers were previously owned by the Asian Spirit, Inc. in 2004, leased later to the Lionair Corporation, but mysteriously sold by the Manila Aerospace Products Trading Corporation to the PNP as brand new in July 2009. The two choppers were delivered, after inspection by a PNP inspection panel, on Feb. 12, 2010.”“Two of the PNP’s choppers were used extensively by members of the former First Family and their friends, including some lawmakers, before they were sold as brand new to the police agency in July 2009,” the department said.Several police officers were fired over the deal. — Kyle Aristophere T. Atienza2GO Travel says most destinations on network now accept tourists2GO Group, Inc.’s 2GO Travel on Thursday said 90% of the destinations on its network now accept tourists.“Fully vaccinated travelers with vaccination cards and certificates can enter Batangas, Caticlan, Butuan, Cagayan de Oro, Cebu, Dumaguete, Iloilo City, Manila, Negros Occidental province, Ozamis, and Roxas without the swab test requirement,” 2GO Travel said in an e-mailed statement.The company also said the Tourism department, through the Tourism Promotions Board, has a financial subsidy program for “qualified domestic tourists traveling to destinations requiring [coronavirus] test requirements.”Application for the free RT-PCR test program is done through www.tpb.gov.ph/rtpcrphtravel/.The government has increased the allowable carrying passenger capacity of passenger ships to 70% earlier this month.“To date, 95% of our vessel crew are fully vaccinated against [the coronavirus]. Nevertheless, we encourage all our passengers to follow safety protocols from check-in, boarding to disembarkation, and to travel safely and responsibly,” 2GO said.2GO Group also announced on Thursday the resignation of its chief operating officer, Waldo C. Basilla, citing “personal reasons.”“The board is reviewing and will disclose management update in due course,” 2GO told BusinessWorld in a phone message when asked who would replace Mr. Basilla. — Arjay L. BalinbinIndonesia to award PHL Defense chief for rescue of 8 kidnapped fishermenINDONESIA is conferring a peace medal to the Philippine’s head of national defense for the rescue of eight Indonesian fishermen kidnapped by the Islamic State-linked Abu Sayyaf group in 2019.Defense Secretary Delfin N. Lorenzana will be the first Filipino to receive the Medali Perdamaian or Medal of Peace, to be given by Indonesian President Joko Widodo.The House of Representatives’ Committee on Foreign Affairs approved a resolution Thursday allowing Mr. Lorenzana to accept the recognition.Under the 1987 Philippine Constitution, government officials would need approval from Congress before receiving awards, presents, office, or title from any foreign government.Foreign Affairs Assistant Secretary Nathaniel G. Imperial told the committee that the acceptance of the award would help cement bilateral ties between the Philippines and Indonesia.The two countries, which are geographically closest through the Philippine’s Sulu province and Indonesia’s Sulawesi, have been conducting joint maritime activities, including security trainings, in the Celebes Sea.“It will be a great honor for Secretary Lorenzana to be the first ever Filipino to receive the prestigious Medal of Peace from no less than the president of Indonesia in recognition of his stewardship and leadership on rescue of Indonesians,” Mr. Imperial said.He also asked the committee to grant similar approval for former Armed Forces of the Philippines chief Cirilito E. Sobejana and the rescue team who are expected to receive the same award from Mr. Widodo. — Russell Louis C. KuSolons call for election debates before end of the yearA RESOLUTION was filed at the House of Representatives urging the Commission on Elections (Comelec) to start holding debates before the end of the year for top national positions to give voters more time to know their candidates’ qualifications and platforms.House Resolution 2346, filed on Thursday by seven lawmakers led by Taguig-Pateros Rep. Alan Peter S. Cayetano, suggests that Comelec hold at least five debates from Dec. 2021 to April 2022 with all presidential candidates.It also proposes for the poll body to hold at least 15 weekly debates where two presidential candidates will be invited in each discussion.“Debates will further serve as basis for accountability of elected officials and allow a safer way of information dissemination during this pandemic,” according to the resolution.Comelec Spokesperson James B. Jimenez said last month that three face- to-face debates will be held for both presidential and vice-presidential candidates. — Russell Louis C. KuDela Rosa says anti-communist fund needed for economic, social projectsSENATOR Ronald M. dela Rosa sought the return of the P28-billion original allocation of an ad hoc anti-communist task force in the 2022 budget, saying it is needed to roll out economic and social programs in remote communities to fully address the roots of insurgency.“Even though we are able to kill the last insurgent, but the root cause of (the) insurgency which is poverty and social injustice brought about decades of government neglect is not addressed, nothing will happen for our problem,” Mr. Dela Rosa, a former police chief and presidential candidate, said Thursday during Thursday’s plenary session.Senator Juan Edgardo “Sonny” M. Angara, chair of the Senate finance committee, agreed with Mr. Dela Rosa’s position but reiterated that the problem is not the program per se but the task force’s failure to submit timely reports on its utilization of this year’s P19.3-billion budget.Under the Senate version of the 2022 national budget, the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict’s (NTF-ELCAC) allocation was cut to P4 billion.“Even the best programs on paper must be justified by the implementation,” said Mr. Angara, noting that if there is proof of good implementation then increased funding would not be a problem.“In fact, we even left P4 billion despite not knowing, this is a blind allocation in effect,” he added.The NTF-ELCAC fund is supposedly distributed to local governments for projects in areas that are declared free from communist insurgents.Senate Minority Leader Franklin M. Drilon said these projects are just “duplications of the various department’s mandates.”CLIMATE FUNDMeanwhile, the amount allocated to implement climate change initiatives needs to be increased, said Senator Francis N. Tolentino, citing that it may not be enough to fulfill the country’s international commitments.“The Philippines plans to lead climate change response and mitigation but its budget is miniscule,” he said during the plenary session.He noted that the Climate Change Commission only received a P140-million allotment, down from P237 million in 2016.Mr. Angara, however, pointed out that there is a provision in the 2022 proposed budget that earmarks P284.5 million for each line agency’s climate change expenditures, including departments such as Agriculture, Foreign Affairs, Energy, among others.He added that there would also be special-purpose funds that would tackle the adaption and mitigation of climate change.Mr. Tolentino said it would still be insufficient in supporting the commitments made by Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26), since it was only 5.5% of the national budget.“The climate change summit will end tomorrow, and there will be commitments and signing activities that would implicate not just promissory initiatives on the part of the Philippine government but real tangible commitments, such as the budgetary making process,” Mr. Tolentino said.“I endeavor the career members of the Cabinet economic cluster to take that in mind as you move along even though this is a swan song, that there will be commitment to have a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions target by 2050,” he said. — Alyssa Nicole O.

545,Negotiation on climate cash 'must accelerate',"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Western Mail,News,587,NEWS;Pg. 3,587,England & Wales,EMILY BEAMENT,,,,Negotiation on climate cash 'must accelerate',"ALOK SHARMA says negotiations around finance to help developing countries mitigate and adapt to climate change ""need to accelerate and they need to accelerate now"" as the Cop26 summit enters its final days.The failure of developed nations to deliver the long-promised US$100bn in finance to poorer nations has been a major sticking point in the talks so far.Developing nations want commitments to phasing out fossil fuels to be stripped from the cover agreement, arguing being asked to decarbonise without financial support will leave them trapped in poverty.At a press conference yesterday, an exhausted-looking Mr Sharma, the summit's president, said: ""Negotiations on finance really need to accelerate and they need to accelerate now.""Having engaged extensively with parties of the past year and at Cop, I know that everyone understands what is at stake for the future of our planet here in Glasgow.""He continued: ""We still have a monumental challenge ahead of us, but collectively we have no choice but to rise to that challenge and strain every sinew to achieve a timely outcome that we can all be proud of.""Because ultimately, this outcome, whatever it is, will belong to all of us.""His words were echoed by UN secretary general Antonio Guterres emphasised that under current plans, the world is still on course for temperature rises well above 2°C.""Promises ring hollow when the fossil fuels industry still receives trillions in subsidies, as measured by the IMF, or when countries are still building coal plants, or when carbon is still without a price, distorting markets and investors decisions,"" he said.Mr Guterres added: ""The announcements here in Glasgow are encouraging but they are far from enough.""The emissions gap remains a devastating threat, the finance and adaptation gap represent a glaring injustice for the developing world.""With Glasgow failing to close the gap, the pressure is now on countries to agree on a deal that will ensure they take mitigation action to cut emissions in the 2020s and keep the 1.5°C goal within reach, as well as deliver on finance. A first draft of the cover decision includes a commitment to phase out fossil fuels, the first time this has ever appeared in such a text.But few people think it will make it into the final document.A coalition of developing nations in particular are unhappy at the wording on phasing out coal, oil and gas, particularly when commitments on finance have not yet been met, and want any reference to carbon ""mitigation"" removed completely.On behalf of a block of 24 nations known as the Like-Minded Group of Developing Countries (LMDC), Bolivia's chief negotiator Diego Pacheco Balanza said rich countries were encroaching on the ""carbon space"" of poorer ones.The citizens of LMDC countries account for around half of the global population.At a press conference, Mr Balanza said: ""That space is for the developmental rights of the developing world and also for the protection of mother earth.""Mr Balanza said framing the climate crisis as one of shared responsibility would ""trap"" developing countries in poverty, adding only developed nations have the resources to swiftly decarbonise their economies.""We know that this narrative will allow (rich countries) again to control the world, and those countries that are not able to achieve the (net zero by 2050) target will be financially condemned,"" he said.He added: ""Under the Paris Agreement finance is an obligation, finance is not a charity to developing countries from the developed world.""",Copyright 2021 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|WWM|ENGLISH|National Edition|CLIMATE CHANGEDEVELOPING COUNTRIESEMISSIONSPRESS CONFERENCESAGREEMENTSINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUNDUNITED NATIONSNEGATIVE NEWSPOVERTY & HOMELESSNESS|EMISSIONSENERGY & UTILITIESINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUNDCOAL FIRED PLANTSOIL & GAS INDUSTRYCOAL INDUSTRY|ANTONIO GUTERRES|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|EARTH|BOLIVIA",

""The artists' work is all about celebrating the connection to the Earth and extending this love to all the world.""The festival coincides with COP26, so we invited artists to show ecosexual work, which brings a real sense of joy and hope for environmental campaigners.""This year's theme is Wired Women and aims to address the digital gender divide and highlight the contribution of female and non-binary artists in shaping the digital and technology-driven arts sector.The four-day festival features exhibitions, talks, performances and discussion until tomorrow, Saturday November 13.Ecosexuals Beth Stephens and Annie Sprinkle will present a series of new digital collages entitled Assuming the Ecosexual Position, at Slessor Gardens.Their work is steeped in humour and love, presenting the Earth as their lover and exploring issues such as feminism, gender, sexuality and materialism.A new bespoke online festival platform created by Rifke Sadleir is being created to host exhibitions, screenings, new commissioned text works and interactive games, showcasing the festival across the globe.Padmini Ray Murray, working remotely from Bangladesh, will present an online game world, an interactive environment centred on the idea of data trust and data commons, using the garden or seed bank as a metaphor.People will be able to interact in the space and upload things to make plants and trees grow - a collaborative online worldmaking. The work provides an opportunity and context to start conversations about ownership of archives and decentralised data trusts, corporate data ownership and exploitative use of data. Meanwhile, activist and artist FannieSosa is creating a White Institution's Guide (WIG) to welcome artists of colour and their audiences.Taking the form of seven creatures found on the shores of the Black Atlantic, this interactive web-based resource aims to answer questions people might have about inviting artists of colour to a white institution.One of the festival's live events will be held at Overgate Shopping Centre in Dundee, which will host Camille Baker's new multisensory, immersive art installation INTER/her.This work, which was shortlisted for the Lumen Prize in the 3D/Interactive category, takes Camille's personal experience and those of other women who have had post-reproductive diseases and pain to create a virtual reality, sound and haptic installation.The work explores the psychological issues of womanhood, the sense of self and the inconsistencies in support for women's health, drawing on Camille's experience of the healthcare system.Other exhibiting artists include Rosana Cade, Holly White, Helen Pritchard,Femke Snelting, Shannon McRae, Camara Taylor, Dr Lee Weinberg, hidden route and Hayley Blakeman, and Semiconductor.""Because it's a digital festival to begin with, it lends itself to being presented online, more so than other art forms,"" adds Ailie Rutherford.""The only disappointing thing is that all these really exciting artists aren't going to be able to fly to Dundee this year and have a big opening event. It would be amazing to have all these interesting people in a room together.""I would be really hopeful that in future, if I'm involved in the festival again, we will be able to all get together in person, but I also think the hybrid model works well. It allows for wider accessibility for people with disabilities, or who live far away, or are single parents who can't get out for the night.""It's important to state that the festival centres the experience of women, including trans and intesex women. Quite a few of the artists are non-binary. They use the pronoun 'they' rather than 'she'.""The digital gender divide exists on many levels, an obvious example being that there are far fewer women working in tech and very few tech companies are run by women. This means that the technology that shapes our lives very much centres the worldview of white, Western men.""These issues intercept gender, race and class, and are really important things to talk about.""",Copyright 2021 DC Thomson Co Ltd All Rights Reserved,,Newspaper|TCR|ENGLISH|National Edition|ARTISTS & PERFORMERSFESTIVALSTRENDS & EVENTSARTS FESTIVALS & EXHIBITIONSDIGITAL DIVIDEGENDER EQUALITYFEMINISM & WOMEN'S RIGHTSVISUAL ARTSTELECOMMUTING|ARTISTS & PERFORMERSFESTIVALSARTS FESTIVALS & EXHIBITIONSENTERTAINMENT & ARTSINTERNET & WWWVISUAL ARTS,

Frontline staff have sent out their own 999 call to thisGovernment. Scotland's NHS needs more support. This winter is going to be its toughest ever test.'The survey of 300 Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) staff by Unite Scotland found that 88 per cent do not feel valued by the Scottish Government, 98 per cent say extra support provided over winter will not be enough and 79 per cent say the service is understaffed. Some 86 per cent feel fatigued, 74 per cent have considered quitting, and 54 per cent say there are not enough ambulances.Pat Rafferty of Unite said: 'The [SAS] workers are sending out their own 999 call to the Government saying that they are undervalued, stressed and exhausted.'Shockingly, the survey reveals a culture of extremely long hours, partially due to chronic underfunding over many years.'It's a devastating indictment of the Government's approach to the ambulance service.' Mr Swinney said the service is under pressure because of a 'significant increase in demand' caused by Covid.He added that the Government is 'absolutely determined to ensure that we use all of the resources available to us to make sure individuals receive the care they require'.But, referring to the Unite survey, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar told him: 'The facts are this - 79 per cent believe that they are understaffed and there are not enough of them. Listen to NHS staff, don't ignore them.'The Scottish Lib Dems also released a freedom of information response which showed that 201 ambulance workers were absent for 40,355 hours due to anxiety, stress, depression or other psychiatric illness between July and September 2021, compared with the same period in 2017, when 63 staff missed 9,734 hours.Party leader Alex Cole-Hamilton urged Mr Swinney 'to stop blaming the pandemic and accept that his Government is letting these vital staff down'.An SAS spokesman said: 'We take the mental health of our staff very seriously, which is why we have developed a robust programme to support them.'COVID UPDATE 3,340 new positive cases in Scotland (down 512) 26 deaths (up 7) 768 Scots with Covid in hospital (down 10) 60 in intensive care (down 1)4,326,392 total of first vaccinations (up 1,085)3,921,971 total of second vaccinations (up 1,965)1,084,891 total of booster vaccinations (up 34,292)'The Government is letting vital staff down'",Copyright 2021 Associated Newpapers Ltd.

The Glasgow Declaration brings together key players in the biomass supply chain \xE2 from sustainable forestry through to the pellet producers, the shippers and ports to the electricity generators \xE2 all combining to reaffirm our commitment to work together to meet the net zero challenge.\xE2We have achieved a lot so far, especially here at Lynemouth, and have a solid base upon which to build. Therefore, we want to make the maximum possible contribution to net zero by realising the full potential of sustainable bioenergy.""When it\xE2s still and dark, when there\xE2s no wind or sun, we still need heat, light and power.\xE2She also warned\xC2against complacency and for Lynemouth Power Station, this also means a comprehensive review of options for the plant from 2027 onwards when the current Contract for Difference scheme ends. This includes the potential for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) with negative CO2 emissions from BECCS allowing the UK to offset CO2 emissions from hard to decarbonise sectors \xE2 a major step change in current thinking and clearly an important tool for net zero.She added, \xE2This means working collaboratively with the wider bioenergy industry and the UK Government, and we have had very constructive dialogue with the Government during the review of its Bioenergy Strategy. We therefore welcome the recent update.\xE2Biomass has already provided a significant contribution towards decarbonisation of UK electricity generation, and the Government has recognised that, as a minimum, this needs to continue and where possible expand. We are making great progress in understanding what continued operations look like for Lynemouth after 2027 and how this fits into the wider net zero ambition. This includes a good understanding of how BECCS could be applied to the site, how this would interface with our existing operations, and what work is required to extend the operating period of the existing plant.\xE2\xC2Keep up to date with all the latest news on our website, or follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.You can also follow our dedicated County Durham Facebook page for all the latest in the area by clicking here.For all the top news updates from right across the region straight to your inbox, sign up to our newsletter here.Have you got a story for us?

550,Not out of the woods: COVID cases rising in Western Europe,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),News,1138,NEWS;Version:1,1138,England & Wales,Via AP news wire,,,,Not out of the woods: COVID cases rising in Western Europe,"Santa  won't be getting his traditional welcome in the Dutch city of Utrecht this year. The ceremonial head of Carnival celebrations in Germany  s Cologne had to bow out because he tested positive for COVID-19. And Austria is considering imposing a lockdown on unvaccinated people.Nearly two years into a global health crisis that has killed more than 5 million people, infections are again sweeping across parts of Western Europe  a region with relatively high vaccination rates and good health care systems but where lockdown measures are largely a thing of the past.The World Health Organization said coronavirus deaths rose by 10% in Europe in the past week, and an agency official declared last week that the continent was ""back at the epicenter of the pandemic."" Much of that is being driven by spiraling outbreaks in Russia and Eastern Europe - where vaccination rates tend to be low - but countries in the west such as Germany and Britain recorded some of the highest new case tolls in the world.While nations in Western Europe all have vaccination rates over 60% - and some like Portugal and Spain  are much higher - that still leaves a significant portion of their populations without protection.Dr. Bharat Pankhania, senior clinical lecturer at Exeter University College of Medicine and Health, says that the large number of unvaccinated people combined with a widespread post-lockdown resumption of socializing and a slight decline in immunity for people who got their shots months ago is driving up the pace of infections.Thanks largely to vaccination, hospitals in Western Europe are not under the same pressure they were earlier in the pandemic, but many are still straining to handle rising numbers of COVID patients while also attempting to clear backlogs of tests and surgeries with exhausted or sick staff. Even the countries experiencing the most serious outbreaks in the region recorded far fewer deaths per person over the past four weeks than the United States did, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.The question now is if countries can tamp down this latest upswing without resorting to stringent shutdowns that devastated economies, disrupted education and weighed on mental health. Experts say probably - but authorities can't avoid all restrictions and must boost vaccination rates.""I think the era of locking people up in their homes is over because we now have tools to control COVID - the testing, vaccines and therapeutics,"" said Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh. ""So I hope people will do the things they have to do, like put on a mask.""Many European countries now use COVID passes - proof of full vaccination, recovery from the virus or a negative test result - to access venues like bars and restaurants. Pankhania warned that the passes can give a false sense of security since fully vaccinated people can still get infected - though their chances of dying or getting seriously sick are dramatically lower.But restrictions don't go much further these days, although the Dutch government reportedly is considering a limited two-week lockdown and German lawmakers are mulling legislation that would pave the way for new measures. Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said this week that a lockdown for the unvaccinated is ""probably unavoidable,"" but he doesn't want to impose the measure on those who got the shot.Austria is seeing one of the most serious outbreaks in Western Europe, along with Germany, which has reported a string of record-high infections in recent days. ""We have a real emergency situation right now,"" said Christian Drosten, the head of virology at Berlin's Charite Hospital, which has started canceling scheduled surgeries. Duesseldorf's university hospital said earlier this week that its ICU is full, though many facilities are struggling more with staff shortages than bed space. Drosten said Germany must increase its vaccination rate of 67% further - and fast. But officials have balked at ordering vaccine mandates and want to avoid any blanket lockdowns.Health Minister Jens Spahn indicated that Germany could improve its often lax enforcement of COVID pass requirements. ""If my vaccination certificate is checked more often in one day in Rome than it sometimes is in four weeks in Germany, then I think more can be done,"" Spahn said recently.The Netherlands is in a similar bind: The country announced the highest daily tally of new cases since the pandemic began Thursday, hospitals are warning the situation could get worse, but officials are reluctant to clamp down too hard. Amid these concerns, organizers in Utrecht said they couldn't in good conscience bring tens of thousands of people together to greet Santa at the annual Sinterklaas party beloved of children.Cities in Germany, by contrast, went ahead with outdoor Carnival celebrations this week - but the head of Cologne's party, Carnival Prince Sven I., canceled public appearances after testing positive.In the United Kingdom, which lifted remaining restrictions in July and has seen big spikes as well as dips in cases since, Prime Minister Boris Johnson insists the country can ""live with the virus."" The government will only reimpose restrictions if the health service comes under ""unsustainable"" pressure, he says. Spain, once one of Europe's hardest hit nations, perhaps offers an example of how the risks can be managed. It has vaccinated 80% of its population, and while face masks are no longer mandatory outdoors, many people still wear them. While infections have ticked up slightly recently, Rafael Bengoa, one of Spain's leading public health experts, said that given the high vaccination rate, ""the virus won't be able to dominate us again.""Several countries are hoping that pushing harder on immunizations will get them there. Germany plans to re-open vaccination centers across the country to speed booster shots. France is also pinning its hopes on booster doses while urging holdouts to get their first shots. Italy is also expanding its booster program as numbers edge higher.Pankhania says that no single measure will control the pandemic. ""To really control it, it has to be multi-layered ... avoid crowds, avoid poorly ventilated places, be immunized, wear your mask,"" he said.___Associated Press reporters across Europe contributed.___Follow AP's coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic.

Moe made the comment, an extension and expansion of ideas he's advocated before, while appearing last Sunday on the Roy Green Show. ""We're really starting to feel the differences between Saskatchewan and where our federal government is heading is we're actually, at this point in time ... more like a nation within Canada,"" Moe said.He was discussing the moves by the Justin Trudeau government at the COP26 summit in Glasgow, Scotland, to unilaterally announce hard caps on greenhouse gas emissions without consultation, but his frustration with Ottawa is wider than just that issue. And his frustration is not new for those who have been paying attention.""In light of the federal government's continued attacks on our economy, in particular our energy sector, our government needs to assert and protect Saskatchewan's economic sovereignty,"" Moe told me via email Thursday.""This would not be necessary if we could count on our federal government to advance Saskatchewan's economic interests. But we can't.""Moe wants more powers for his province over immigration, policing, taxation, responsible firearms policy and international relations. All powers Quebec currently exercises; in fact, Ontario also exercises many of them.The CBC attempted to dismiss this push for a deal similar to Quebec's as illtimed due to Saskatchewan's COVID efforts, a distraction from Moe's failures, if you will.

Canada's establishment doesn't like when one of these Prairie upstarts asks to be treated fairly.It's the same reaction when Alberta makes similar demands or when the famous Firewall Letter is used as shorthand to denigrate a western politician or the ideas they are putting forward.

Sure, Ontario and Quebec have that, but they are different, special.And who could support provinces collecting more of their own tax revenue? Well, other than every party recognized in the House of Commons right now - they all support giving Quebec more taxation powers; it was an issue in the last election.Canada is supposed to be a federation of provinces coming together to allow the federal government to handle things that they are best suited to do. People in Eastern Canada, though, tend to view the Prairies provinces as if they are still territories, not equal partners - it's like the kid brother you won't let grow up.It's a viewpoint quite prevalent in the federal government and it shows up in its policies and attitudes toward the West.So instead of dismissing people like Moe when they speak up about their frustrations, our establishment pundits and our elected leaders could try to understand where the frustration is coming from.

559,Our national literature has long backed the indy cause,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Herald (Glasgow),News,1478,Pg. 19,1478,Scotland,Drew Allan ,,,,Our national literature has long backed the indy cause,"AS a lover of Scottish literature, Sheila Wallace (Letters, November 11) surely knows that the first major poem in the Scots tongue is Barbour's Brus, an epic celebration of Scotland's resistance to English aggression. From later periods, she is presumably acquainted with Robert Fergusson's The Ghaists, with its lines ""Black be the day that e'er to England's ground, Scotland was eikit by the Union's bond!"", and with Robert Burns's bitter diatribe against Scotland's loss of independence, ""Such a parcel of rogues in a nation"".She should also be familiar with the fiery expressions of radical Scottish nationalism in Hugh MacDiarmid's poetry, and in that of the galaxy of superb Scots-writing poets whom his work inspired: Tom Scott, Sydney Goodsir Smith and Douglas Young, to mention only three of the greatest. I recall from distant student days a symposium in Glasgow University Union at which Norman MacCaig declared: ""Every poet in Scotland is a Scottish nationalist"": other eminent figures of the literary scene were also present, and certainly none of them raised a dissenting voice. That was more than half a century ago but I can think of precious few Scottish writers from that day to this who have not been overt supporters of independence.The association of our national literature with the cause of independence is not, as Sheila Wallace appears to think, a recent disreputable aberration, but a central fact of the entire field, particularly in the 20th and 21st centuries. Why else does she think generations of Scottish schoolchildren have been deliberately kept in ignorance of most of it?Derrick McClure, Aberdeen.CORRESPONDENCE from John Dunlop (November 9) and Sheila Wallace (November 11) describes alarm that Scottish music, poetry and literature is somehow spoiled and exploited by ""nationalists"".Our culture had been founded in a wild amalgamation of local and international influences. I play traditional music and the number of tunes that share Irish and Scottish roots is considerable.This music is not nationalistic. Rather it is very local, with styles and repertoire changing from area to area. It is also international, shared by enthusiastic players across the globe.Allan McDougall, Neilston.Time to look at outside fundingOPPONENTS of self-government get worked up when celebrities have their tuppence worth, but far more insidious is people living outside Scotland spending large sums to secretly influence events in Scotland, normally by extreme right-wing organisations, and the Electoral Commission needs to clamp down on anonymous third-party funding in elections and referenda.For example, the recently published expenditure for May's Scottish elections included £56,256 by the anti-independence grouping Scotland Matters, who were bankrolled to the extent of £46,000 by the unknown Centre for Economic Education and Training, which only has a London PO Box address with no record of who is a member or who is funding it and did not register with the Electoral Commission. A further £19,000 donation to Scotland Matters was from a London-based former Tory researcher, so the vast bulk of its funding was from outside Scotland.The same applies to the new Scotland Office minister, and Lords peer, Malcolm Offord's so-called grass-roots London-based No Borders organisation that spent £150,000 during the 2014 referendum campaign and received £50,000 from Stalbury Trustees, based in England and whose stated company objective is ""the promotion of the Conservative Party"".Fraser Grant, Edinburgh.In search of compromiseWILLIE Maclean (Letters, November 11) is quite mistaken to describe my position on a second referendum as being that future voters ""should never have the opportunity to cast a vote on the independence question"".On the contrary, as regular readers know, I have consistently argued for a New Act of Union that provides a unilateral route to secession, subject to a referendum based on best practice elsewhere (which may include super-majorities and double majorities). This is my reasonable suggestion for a compromise which respects the outcome of the 2014 vote and would ensure that independence would only happen if it was the settled will of a clear majority.However, the concepts of ""reasonable"" and ""compromise"" are unrecognisable to the nationalist mindset.Peter A Russell, Glasgow.Little has changed since 2014THE SNP has never really got over its defeat in the 2014 referendum.It is certainly worth noting that in the most recent Holyrood elections the number of votes cast for the SNP amounted to 2,385,788, while the Conservative/Labour/Liberal Democrat voters added up to 2,624,825. In percentage terms this is roughly a ratio of 47.6/52.4, which is very close to the results in the independence referendum. So, one can only conclude that nothing really much has changed - the majority of Scots still wish to remain in the UK.The recent agreement on the part of the SNP to come to a deal with the largely unelected Scottish Greens merely leads to a greater impasse, rather than any political advantage.One could well suggest that this is just another attempt by the SNP to try to undermine the sound economy and political leadership of these islands.Scotland's future will be far safer politically, and economically, if it continues as a constituent part of the UK.Robert IG Scott, Ceres, Fife.A Baron  argumentDR Angus Macmillan (Letters, November 11) refers to the fact that the Labour Party has colluded with the system associated with appointments to the House of Lords for years. Who once said ""The House of Lords must go - not be reformed, not be replaced, not be reborn in some nominated life after-death patronage paradise, just closed down, abolished, finished""? Answer: Neil Kinnock in 1976 .What is he today? Answer: Baron Kinnock of Bedwellty.That just about says it all.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.Europe against nuclear weaponsRETIRED Irish Defence Force Colonel Dorcha Lee writes that ""Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey are storing US nuclear weapons, without any public concern"" (""Would an independent Scotland be vulnerable? Not necessarily"", The Herald, November 11). Polling by ICAN, the international campaign to abolish nuclear weapons, in four of the five countries Col Lee references, suggests otherwise.The public in these four countries were asked if the US tactical nuclear weapons should be removed and responded in the affirmative as follows: Belgium 57%, The Netherlands 58%, Italy 74% and Germany 83%. Figures for Turkey are not available.These polls reveal that anti-nuclear sentiment, particularly among the original Western European members of Nato, is considerable. It is another sign of Scotland's Western European political cultural alignment in general and that Scottish anti-nuclear sentiment is not some sort of outlier. It is Brexit Britain that is the real outlier.At its August conference, the SNP passed a motion by more than 500 votes to 14 endorsing the earlier decision of all SNP parliamentarians to sign the ICAN parliamentary pledge that an independent Scotland would swiftly sign the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) which came into force at the UN in January 2021.The TPNW has 86 state signatories and so far 56 states have ratified it, a number that will grow by the time it has its COP1 hosted by the Austrian Government in Vienna next March.Bill Ramsay, Convener, SNP CND, Glasgow.A good COP for First MinisterI ALWAYS enjoy Alison Rowat's rapier-sharp wit, but if ""Mr B Johnson of London"" has indeed left the comment she imagines, that Glasgow is a ""fab bolthole if up to neck in sleaze row"", Mr Johnson, with sleaze now over his head, will find it well-nigh impossible to rise above it, whether in Glasgow or anywhere else (""Just for a while, the world really did belong to Glasgow"", The Herald, November 11). And although he'd ditched the plane on his return to the climate conference, his arrival as he alighted from the train was greeted with less than enthusiasm from the reception committee.However, even more of an irritant to Mr Johnson must be the high profile Scotland's First Minister has achieved at the conference. Mr Johnson infamously told the Scottish Tories he didn't want Nicola Sturgeon ""anywhere near it"", although he had to do a U-turn on that, given that Nicola Sturgeon is First Minister of the country where the conference is taking place. Then there was the Tory MP alleging that the three objectives at COP26 were ""Save the planet. Save the country. And stop Sturgeon getting a photo with Biden"". That one didn't go well for Mr Johnson either.As for the overall verdict on the conference, Ms Rowat is right to sum it up as ""jury out"". But whether it has been a good COP, a bad COP, or a COP-out, only time will tell. The problem is that the planet doesn't have time.Ruth Marr, Stirling.",Copyright 2021 Newsquest Media Group All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|HER|ENGLISH|agriculturebusinesshealth termspolitical partiesweather|POETRYLITERATUREWRITERSASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONSCELEBRITIESEDUCATION & TRAININGFAR RIGHT POLITICSPOLITICAL EXTREMISMPOLITICAL PARTIESPOLITICSSEPARATISM & SECESSIONSTUDENTS & STUDENT LIFECONFERENCES & CONVENTIONSCHILDRENELECTION AUTHORITIESREFERENDUMS|WRITERSCELEBRITIESMEDIA & TELECOMMUNICATIONS|GLASGOW, SCOTLANDABERDEEN, SCOTLAND|SCOTLANDENGLAND",
560,Pact delivers momentum for hope at summit,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,"The Age (Melbourne, Australia)",News,400,NEWS;Pg. 10,400,Australia,Nick O'Malley,,,,Pact delivers momentum for hope at summit,"Glasgow: China and the United States have boosted the global climate talks with their joint statement, quelling lingering fears that the summit might end in failure and opening the door to the acceleration of a global green economic transition.It doesn't mean the work of COP26 is done, just that there are fewer roadblocks to achieving success.The specific goals of the British hosts of the talks are to shift the world's attention to the more ambitious Paris Agreement goal of holding warming to 1.5 degrees, to drive members of the agreement to increase ambitions in keeping with such a target, and to set a timeline on ending the use of fossil fuels.In reality, none of these objectives were ever going to be achieved over 10 days in Glasgow, but if the summit is to succeed, momentum towards these aims needs to quicken. The China-US joint statement is an accelerant. It endorses the focus of the summit on driving ambitious action before 2030, rather than relying on mid-century targets, and on the primacy of the 1.5-degree goal over the 2-degree one also found in the Paris Agreement but no longer seen as sufficient to save some nations.It does not, however, specifically mention the fossil fuel phase-out.Where the joint statement does delve into specifics, it is on areas where there is little contention - the sharing of green-tech expertise, smoothing out regulations, and concrete action on reducing methane emissions. But the statement's significance does not lie in its detail, rather in its weight.""Co-operation is the only choice for ... China and the United States,"" Chinese climate envoy Xie Zhenhua said. ""By working together, our two countries can achieve many important things that are beneficial not only to our two countries, but to the world as a whole.""Climate Council chief researcher Simon Bradshaw said: ""With this statement, the world's two most powerful countries and biggest emitters have committed to working together to accelerate action.""The statement defuses the greatest single threat to the talks: the finger pointing between the two nations. China had accused the US of failing to act on its pronouncements, while the US accused China of being absent from the talks and reluctant on the issue.The rift had been giving cover to smaller parties with an interest in retarding climate action, said Byford Tsang, a China specialist with global climate think tank E3G.",Copyright 2021 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|AGREEMENTSCLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION & POLICYENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRYGREENHOUSE GASESGREEN ECONOMYEMISSIONSENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGYRESEARCH INSTITUTES|ENERGY & UTILITIESENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRYGREEN ECONOMYEMISSIONSMETHANE|MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIAGLASGOW, SCOTLAND|VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA|CHINAUNITED STATESAUSTRALIA",
561,Pertamina puts price tag on first CCS projects,"November 12, 2021",International,Asia Oil & Gas Monitor Today,News,338,,338,England & Wales,,,PT PERTAMINA (PERSERO),PT PERTAMINA (PERSERO)EXXON MOBIL CORP,Pertamina puts price tag on first CCS projects,"Indonesia's state-owned Pertamina has estimated that installing the country's first two carbon capture storage (CCS) projects could cost as much as $500mn. Pertamina is studying the installation of CCS facilities at the Gundih and Sukowati oil and gas fields, senior vice-president of corporate strategy Daniel Purba told Reuters on November 8. Gundih is located in Central Java's Cepu district, while Sukowati lies within East Java's Bojonegoro district. Purba said Pertamina was studying the construction of two pipelines to connect Gundih and Sukowati to a single reservoir. Gundih lies 4 km from the proposed CCS project, while Sukowati would be connected via a 30-km pipeline. ""Both projects are still in the study phase,"" Purba said, before adding that the study itself had started before the state major signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the US' ExxonMobil on CCS use within the country. Under the MoU, which was signed on November 2 during the COP26 summit in Glasgow, the companies agreed to evaluate the potential for large-scale deployment of low-carbon technologies in Indonesia. ""We are evaluating large-scale [CCS] projects that have the potential to make the greatest impact in the highest-emitting sectors around the world,"" ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions president Joe Blommaert said at the time. ""And there are opportunities in Indonesia and throughout Southeast Asia."" The head of Indonesia's upstream regulator SKK Migas, Dwi Soetjipto, said the MoU was a step towards CCS being used at ExxonMobil-operated Cepu block, which is the country's largest oil producer. Both ExxonMobil and Pertamina own 45% of Cepu, which contains the Banyu Urip field. Pertamina CEO Nick Widyawati, meanwhile, has said previously that her company sees CCS as key to its transition toward clean energy. The state major has said it intends to reduce its carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to 81.4mn tonnes by 2060 in support of Jakarta's decision to bring forward the country's net-zero emissions goal from 2070 to 2060.

566,PM's reliance on market forces the hand of voters,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Sydney Morning Herald (Australia),News,516,OPINION;Letters;Pg. 30,516,Australia,,,,,PM's reliance on market forces the hand of voters,"""We're respecting consumers choices not telling them what to do with mandates,"" says Scott Morrison (""Morrison favours 'climate capitalism' to lower emissions"", November 11). But we're not simply consumers, we're citizens of this country. We have needs such as roads, hospitals and schools. Even more basically, we need food, water, oxygen and reasonable temperatures to survive. Big business needs certainty to be able to invest in new technologies. Please, give us mandates Prime Minister: it's actually called governing and requires you to step up and be the leader we elected you to be.Elisabeth Goodsall, WahroongaThe main cause of climate change is capitalism and our addiction to economic growth. It has got us where we are, and our Prime Minister wants to keep fuelling it. The PM has a tendency to ignore the complexity of problems: a worrying trait. It takes political expertise and statesmanship to tackle the complex problem of climate change. The question is, do we have the leaders to do that?Alice Spigelman, Wildes MeadowThis government won't tell people what to do. What a leader. Once again Morrison is leaving the big issues to market forces. Rather than addressing the causes of climate change and acting on coal regulation, setting a carbon tax on big polluters and acting on cogent scientific evidence, he's leaving it up to the market and dodgy technologies to resolve. He doesn't get sustainable economics, he only gets more unsustainable growth and manifest capitalism.Laurelle Atkinson, St Helens (Tas)The draft decision paper released in the COP26 wrap-up urges Australia to increase its 2030 emission reduction target (""Australia urged to lift 2030 targets"", November 11). There is only one way the conservatives can be nudged to do this and that is fear of an electoral backlash if Labor outlines a respectably higher target and acceptable means of achieving it.Geoff Harding, ChatswoodOddly, I believed that a government should lead. What else is it for? Our government seems to believe that it's up to everybody other than itself to do the hard yards. The ""can-do capitalism"" Morrison refers to attempts to absolve his government from all responsibility. He clearly doesn't want to be blamed for his plan's weakness or failure - that'll be over to us. But who do you think will get all the credit should emissions reductions work?Judy Hungerford, North Curl CurlIf capitalism had dictated our response to the pandemic I very much doubt the common good of public health would have got a look in. Governments should govern for the common good. Our Prime Minister wants to abdicate his government's responsibility for this role and let the mighty dollar take over. Just look how that has played out in aged care.Judith Fleming, SawtellThe more the PM pushes his scare campaign about how disastrous a Labor government would be, the more it will become obvious that the Coalition has very little of its own to offer the voter.

571,Qatar Airways becomes first cargo carrier to join IATA CO2NNECT platform,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Qatar Tribune,News,585,,585,"Qatar, State of",,,QATAR AIRWAYS,QATAR AIRWAYS,Qatar Airways becomes first cargo carrier to join IATA CO2NNECT platform,"Tribune News NetworkDOHAIn partnership with the International Air Transport Association (IATA), Qatar Airways Cargo, the freight division of Qatar Airways Group, will become the first cargo carrier to join the IATA CO2NNECT platform and offer a customised environmental solution for its clients. Kuehne+Nagel, one of the world's leading freight forwarders, will be the launch customer for the platform, in line with their commitment to sustainability. To mark this partnership, on November 1, 2021 Qatar Airways Cargo operated the first carbon-neutral air freight shipments from Doha to Frankfurt, Zaragoza, Liège and Paris.This new chapter of the voluntary carbon offsetting programme, built under an IATA umbrella, establishes an industry milestone to accelerate the decarbonisation of aviation and enables air cargo shipments to become carbon neutral by offering an integrated carbon calculation and offset solution between Qatar Airways, shippers, and freight forwarders such as Kuehne+Nagel. It will provide its customers assurance that the credits bought to offset these emissions are from projects delivering independently verified carbon reductions, as well as wider environmental and social benefits.The pilot project was launched on four routes, with plans to extend to the rest of its cargo network of over 60 freighter destinations and more than 140 passenger destinations worldwide. The pilot uses an IATA industry best practice for calculating CO2 emissions per freight kg. With this programme, cargo customers can easily offset the emissions associated with the air freight shipments, as a step towards achieving their environmental sustainability commitments. Only verified, high quality and ICAO CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) eligible offsets will be used.Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker said: ""As Qatar Airways first launched its carbon offset programme for passengers in 2020, we are pleased to now offer them the option of transporting the air cargo in a CO2 neutral way in the future. Qatar Airways Cargo has always been at the forefront of industry initiatives. I am proud of our efforts to support aviation industry in achieving the ambitious carbon emission reduction targets.""Willie Walsh, IATA's director general, said, ""The industry target of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 applies to both passengers and cargo. It also needs all stakeholders in the industry to work together and embrace innovative solutions. Congratulations to Qatar Airways Cargo for being the first to implement CO2NNECT, and to Kuehne+Nagel for being a launch customer. As the world gathers for the COP26 meeting to strengthen global carbon-reduction plans, the launch of this offsetting solution shows our industry-wide commitment to sustainable air cargo.""Qatar Airways Cargo wants to lead the way in meeting customer expectations for the highest standards of environmental sustainability, by offering a voluntary carbon offsetting programme for air freight, a solution that applies industry best practices for carbon calculation and carbon offsetting to ensure more sustainable cargo shipments.As of one the world's leading cargo carriers, Qatar Airways Cargo remains committed to ensuring environmental sustainability in its operations. With the introduction of our Cargo voluntary carbon offsetting programme, we will allow our customers to easily incorporate carbon-neutral business practices into their overall corporate strategy.",Copyright 2021 Qatar Tribune.

579,"Retailers making great strides on climate, but we are not there yet","November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Herald (Glasgow),News,601,Pg. 24,601,Scotland,Scott Wright ,,T J MAXX,T J MAXX,"Retailers making great strides on climate, but we are not there yet","COP26 is almost behind us. It's been exhilarating to see so many countries come together in Glasgow to deliver tangible progress and momentum towards tackling climate change. The attention will now rightly turn from the lofty rhetoric and fresh commitments made in Scotland's largest city to what each of us must do. For retailers, the route forward is clear - we must continue to build the low-carbon retail industry of tomorrow, regardless of the myriad immediate pressures facing the sector today. Imagine for a moment a future where the environmental impact of every purchase is calculated for us at point of sale. A future where our receipt offers us not only the financial cost of our purchases, but its carbon footprint as well. Where we recycle much more alongside our old clothes and glass bottles? Where we repair our broken-down electronics rather than replace them? Where waste is frowned upon and packaging is shunned?We're not there yet, but retailers are already making strides, offering refill zones and more. The speed of change in retail remains breakneck, but it is essential that stores continue to respond to customer demands for more ethical and sustainable goods. Twelve months ago, retailers came together under the banner of the retail consortium's ""Climate Action Roadmap"" with the aim of making the industry and its supply chains carbon neutral by 2040. Given retail and consumers account for a sizeable slice of all carbon emissions, there is both a huge opportunity and massive responsibility on the industry. It will require action from retailers, suppliers, employees, and customers. Today, 80 leading retail brands - including the likes of Schuh, Scotmid and TJ Maxx - have not only committed collectively to putting climate action at the heart of their decision-making, but have started out on the journey to achieving it. It won't be easy, especially as these firms have pledged to decarbonise stores by 2030, deliveries and logistics by 2035, and products by 2040 while helping customers to live low-carbon lifestyles.As the industry's trade body we've spent the past year ensuring these firms have the tools they need.We formed a taskforce under the leadership of the head of the Co-op to drive progress and benchmarking performance against the highest standards; published detailed guidance for retailers on achieving net-zero vehicle logistics and on helping customers to live low-carbon lifestyles; and held workshops offering practical assistance on sustainable sourcing, green data and technology, and decarbonising store estates. Retail is taking its responsibilities seriously. Even before the industry roadmap, it led the way, reducing the environmental impact of its own operations and supporting improvements in the supply chain and with customers. Examples include eliminating microplastics, cutting water usage, removing packaging, refitting stores to be more energy efficient, and working  to implement a deposit return system for drinks containers. Earlier this year, we reported how retailers have already cut greenhouse gas emissions by 49 per cent since 2005. Shoppers tell us they want brands to help them make better choices, and are prepared to back their ethics with their custom. Changing the way we operate is never easy - it will require huge investments of time and money, and a supportive framework from Government. Ultimately, however, it makes good business sense. Retailers see themselves as part of the solution and are determined to bring about the zero-carbon future we all need.

580,Return to gentler times as stand-in shares pain,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Times (London),News,377,NEWS;Pg. 25,377,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Magnus Linklater,,,,Return to gentler times as stand-in shares pain,"Those of us with long memories can reach back to when John Swinney led the SNP and posed tough questions to the Labour-led front bench. Well, toughish.The impression was his leadership lacked something in the aggression department, that he failed, in effect, to hold ministers to account, that he was perhaps a bit too nice. At FMQs he stood in for his first minister, who is at Cop26, and reminded us of gentler times. He was dealing with harsh questions from all three opposition leaders about an ambulance service that seems to be at breaking point, and he agreed with much of the criticism.He heard complaints from Douglas Ross for the Conservatives (deeply concerned), Anas Sarwar for Labour (angry) and Alex Cole-Hamilton, Liberal Democrats (sharply critical), about long waiting times and harrowing deaths.Furrowed of brow, the deputy first minister shared their pain. He knew whereof they spoke, and sympathised with those who had suffered. He was anxious to find solutions. The problem, he said lay in the ""level of demand"". Too many people were in need of ambulances, and ambulances were sometimes in the wrong place. ""I'm troubled by it,"" he said. He listed the money the government was investing but pointed out the pressures arising from the pandemic. What was needed, he said, was something called ""whole-system solutions"".Sarwar was driven to indignation.""Covid can't be the cover,"" he snapped. Ambulance staff were dissatisfied with the government's response, he said, and 98 per cent had said so. What was wanted was action not words. At this point the worm turned, ever so slightly, and we saw Swinney mount a counterattack. ""I'm afraid Mr Sarwar is in denial about the effect of Covid. This is not a problem unique to Scotland; he is skating past the issue in respect of Covid,"" came the blistering Swinney response.It is only fair to point out that the blood did not, at this point, drain from Sarwar's face, he did not reel back, nor did he flinch. Nicola Sturgeon, had she been there, might have put it a bit more strongly. She might indeed have hung the Labour leader out to dry, set about him and boxed him around the ears. That, however, is not the Swinney way. He prefers civilised dialogue. Which is why, perhaps, he is no longer leader.",Copyright 2021 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved,,Newspaper|TIM|ENGLISH|Scotland|SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTYAMBULANCE & RESCUE SERVICESCOVID CORONAVIRUSUK LIBERAL DEMOCRATSUK POLITICAL PARTIESPOLITICAL PARTIES|AMBULANCE & RESCUE SERVICESEMERGENCY VEHICLES|NICOLA STURGEON,

Pelosi's reservations were also due to the fact that Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden had not finalised legislation for the billionaire tax by the time the White House was due to submit an updated framework for the social spending plan, according to the New York Post who cited a senior Democrat aide. The Biden administration agreed to pull the proposed levy in late October that would have targeted around 750 billionaires. This came after the tax faced criticism from a number of senior Democrats, including Pelosi, who complained in a October 26 phone call with senior party officials that the plan was a publicity stunt, according to the Washington Post. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who has proven to be a thorn in Biden's side when it comes to passing spending legislation, also raised objections to the plan.Other senior Democrats also opposed the tax, with Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, sharing Pelosi's reported sentiment telling Politico at the time: 'It's more of a stunt.'House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said he was 'frankly and honestly disappointed' with the proposed tax.The New York Post reported an anonymous Democrat sayhing: 'While I believe the very wealthiest and most fortunate Americans must contribute more to investing in our future ... and paying for our past (e.g. the federal debt), taxing the unrealized gains of a small subset of people is a difficult policy to craft - let alone enforce.'Speaking at the time, Pelosi told CNN that some of the wealth tax would 'probably' be included in the final form of the spending bill.She added: 'It's only 10 percent of what we - you need.' Pelosi is believed to be one of the wealthiest members of Congress, though her exact worth varies between sources.According to campaign finance tracker OpenSecrets, her net worth is at approximately $114 million as of 2018. The website GoBankingRates estimated her net worth to be closer to $120 million in July this year. In 2020, OpenSecrets listed her as the sixth richest member of Congress.According to the website, she was at the time behind only then-Rep. Greg Gianforte (R-Mont.), Rep. Paul Mitchell (R-Mich.), Rep. Vernon Buchanan (R-Fla), Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) and Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.). In the end, the proposed capital gains tax was removed from the framework of the bill. Instead, a proposed 3 percent surtax on those earning more than $10 million per year was included, the Washington Post reported. This came after the White House agreed to drop a proposed 3 percent tax on taxpayers earning over $5 million to meet the demands of Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), according to the newspaper that cited two anonymous sources.In doing so, roughly 35,000 of the wealthiest Americans, or 0.2 percent of the richest 1 percent in the country, were exempt from the tax hike - according to the most recent data from the Internal Revenue Service.The White House is now pushing a new 15 percent minimum tax on corporations, but the measure is also set to face objections this week from renewable energy firms that warn it could undermine the party's climate goals. The behind-the-scenes negotiations illustrate the huge challenge faced by the Biden administration to meet campaign promises, and to fund the president's roughly £2trillion Build Back Better legislation.In Spring, the White House unveiled more than $3trillion worth of new proposed taxes on the wealthy and corporations, targeting many Americans they believe should pay more.But the White House's tax plans have been dramatically overhauled and are not estimated to bring in over $1 trillion less than the original goal the match a similarly smaller spending target. To add to Biden's woes, Manchin may delay President Joe Biden's 'Build Back Better' legislation until next year over inflation worries, Axios reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.The $1.75 trillion proposal aims to expand the social safety net in the United States and boost climate change policy.The House of Representatives passed a separate $1 trillion package of highway, broadband and other infrastructure improvements last week. It was passed by the Senate in August.Biden has spent the last few months promoting the merits of both pieces of legislation.U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Tuesday that the House intends to pass the 'Build Back Better' legislation the week of Nov. 15.Manchin's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report, which coincides with government data that showed prices rose 6.2 percent in October compared with a year ago, the largest annual increase in about 30 years.",Copyright 2021 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

584,Robust on rule-breaking is a bit rich coming from the PM,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),News,640,VOICES;Pg. 31,640,England & Wales,CATHY NEWMAN,,ETON PHARMACEUTICALS INC,ETON PHARMACEUTICALS INC,Robust on rule-breaking is a bit rich coming from the PM,"For a man who's apparently spent a lifetime bending the rules, it took some chutzpah to say - as Boris Johnson did last night - that ""those who break the rules must be investigated and should be punished"".His comments came exactly a week after he sparked a Conservative revolt by pausing punishment for his friend Owen Paterson, who - according to the standards committee - broke the rules on lobbying.From his school days, the prime minister has always given the impression that he doesn't like to do what he's told. His classics teacher at Eton College, Martin Hammond, once complained to his father about his ""gross failure of responsibility"" and concluded: ""I think he honestly believes that it is churlish of us not to regard him as an exception, one who should be free of the network of obligation which binds everyone else.""It was a belief he carried into his professional life - where he was sacked from a newspaper over allegations of making up a quote - and then into politics, where he had to leave the Conservative front bench after misleading his boss about an extra-marital affair.Since entering Downing Street his cavalier attitude has persisted - and his supporters love him for it.Leave aside questions over the funding of the Downing Street wallpaper (he was cleared of breaching the ministerial code) and pressure on him to come clean about the cost of his latest luxury holiday.The prime minister was also accused of looking for ways to dodge Covid quarantine restrictions when he was pinged in the summer and while others diligently did as they were instructed over Christmas, it's alleged he and his wife spent the day with their son's godmother.In all cases, No 10 denies any wrongdoing (as they did when his former chief adviser Dominic Cummings decided to drive to Barnard Castle to test his eyesight during lockdown).Perhaps the relentless focus on protocol misses the point of a freedom-loving prime minister who, like many of his fellow Britons, enjoys plotting his own course.Certainly, as he strove to deliver Brexit, it served Johnson well to cast himself as the man who took a wrecking ball to the petty regulations drawn up by faceless EU bureaucrats, even if that meant being prepared to break international law - something the European Commission says he's flirted with not once, but twice.But while people who voted for him and his fellow revolutionaries over Brexit might have been prepared to see him unravel the rules on Europe, the lobbying furore is quite another matter. It's a fair assumption many voters wanted MPs to bring back £350m for the NHS - not line their own pockets with second jobs.So it's a measure of how rattled Downing Street is that although the prime minister declined repeated invitations to apologise, he several times issued an extremely robust response to questions about sleaze from journalists at the Cop26 press conference on Wednesday.His statements could turn out to be a hostage to fortune, given the prime minister's own conduct is under extensive scrutiny by the opposition.He must either be certain he hasn't broken the rules at any point himself or convinced once again the normal rules won't apply to him.It's quite a gamble. And the longer the sleaze scandal rumbles on, the bigger that gamble looks. Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell used to have a rule that if a story made the headlines for eleven days straight, his political paymasters were in trouble.By my calculations, we're now on day nine and counting. And the prime minister can't have been delighted that he had to interrupt hosting a huge international event to insist ""the UK is not remotely a corrupt country"".Then again, Boris Johnson is the politician who doesn't like to play by the rules. And the public may carry on forgiving him for it.Cathy Newman presents Channel 4 News, weekdays, at 7pm",Copyright 2021 Independent Print Ltd All Rights Reserved,,Newspaper|IA|ENGLISH|ETON PHARMACEUTICALS INC|NAICS541714 RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT IN BIOTECHNOLOGY (EXCEPT NANOBIOTECHNOLOGY)SIC8733 NONCOMMERCIAL RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS|ETON (NASDAQ)|Voices|PRIME MINISTERSBRITISH PRIME MINISTERSHEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENTNEGATIVE NEWSINVESTIGATIONSPOLITICSEUROPEAN UNION INSTITUTIONSEUROPEAN UNIONINTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONSSTANDARDS & MEASUREMENTSMANAGERS & SUPERVISORSBREXITCHRISTMASCOVID CORONAVIRUSINTERNATIONAL LAWCOLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS|COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS|BORIS JOHNSON|EUROPEUNITED KINGDOMEUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES,ETON (NASDAQ)

588,SAP releases new solution to accelerate the circular economy,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Manila Bulletin,News,641,,641,"Philippines, Republic of the",,,SAP SE,SAP SEACCENTURE PLC,SAP releases new solution to accelerate the circular economy,"Manila, Nov. 12 -- SAP SE today announces the availability of SAP Responsible Design and Production, a solution for designing products sustainably and transitioning to a circular economy. This is the latest offering in a growing portfolio of sustainability-specific software applications that help businesses increase their measurement and data management capabilities.As sustainable business regulations, such as plastic taxes, are put in place, the SAP Responsible Design and Production solution enables brands to accelerate their transition to circular-economy business practices. The new solution helps companies gain better visibility of material flows through their processes including tracking and complying with rapidly changing regulations, especially those concerning product packaging and plastics. As businesses increasingly develop sustainable products, managing materials and regulatory data is becoming one of the most complex challenges across the consumer industry today.""The circular economy is based on three principles, driven by design - eliminate waste and pollution, circulate products and materials, and regenerate nature,"" said Andrew Morlet, CEO, Ellen MacArthur Foundation. ""Digital solutions play an important role in the transition to a circular economy. They enable businesses to embed circular practices across their operations, from designing products to reduce waste from the outset, to tracking the lifecycle of the materials they use.""With SAP's new solution, businesses can embed circularity principles into core business processes, helping eliminate waste and unlock new value by designing products to be sustainable from inception. For example, a shampoo brand manager has visibility into the full product lifecycle, including their extended producer responsibility (EPR) obligations and the plastic taxes of different markets. This visibility helps the brand manager make design changes to reduce waste and decisions on how to lower the costs of the downstream re-use and recycling systems.""Every year, we use almost twice the amount of resources than the planet can regenerate,"" said Scott Russell, member of the Executive Board of SAP SE and head of Customer Success, ""Business can play a crucial role in keeping value in our systems for longer through smart, responsible product design that reuses resources rather than disposing of them. There is inherent complexity in designing products that eliminate waste and use responsible materials, but SAP Responsible Design and Production tackles that complexity and offers a 'gold-standard' solution to our customers, helping to deliver circular products and achieve a regenerative economy.""SAP Responsible Design and Production, a cloud-native solution co-developed with Accenture on SAP Business Technology Platform, provides tailored intelligence that enables businesses to keep pace with EPR regulations and plastic taxes, embed circularity principles into core business processes and optimize design for sustainable business. Learn more by reading the blog ""Helping Business Thrive in a Circular Economy.""SAP has led by example as a sustainable business for more than a decade.

589,"Saskatchewan jostles for more autonomy;Province a 'nation within Canada,' premier says, but it's not separating","November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Toronto Star,News,1028,NEWS;Pg. A4,1028,Ontario,Kieran Leavitt Edmonton Bureau With Files From The Canadian Press,,,,"Saskatchewan jostles for more autonomyProvince a 'nation within Canada,' premier says, but it's not separating","If someone asked you to think about Saskatchewan's ""distinct cultural identity,"" what might come to mind?It's a question that could become central for those living in the Prairie province after Premier Scott Moe recently pledged to ""make every attempt and every effort to start to flex our autonomy"" as the province begins to see itself as a ""nation within Canada.""Afterward, he reportedly told journalists that he was not talking about separating from the country.It's about being a ""cultural identity"" within Canada - much as Quebec describes itself.What that identity is, exactly, and how more autonomy in its name might help the province, remain open questions.""That's what I'm not sure of,"" Tom McIntosh, a political scientist at the University of Regina, says with a laugh.""Is Saskatchewan different than Newfoundland? Well, of course it is ... All provinces have sort of unique features to them. That doesn't necessarily make them nations.""Still, the idea made waves this week after Moe appeared on ""The Roy Green Show"" to denounce Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's COP26 promise to cap oil and gas emissions without consulting Saskatchewan. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney voiced frustration about the same circumstance last week.Alberta and Saskatchewan seem to be aligned on fighting for more autonomy from Ottawa. Both say they feel as though the much-relied-upon energy sector is under attack from the federal Liberals. Both provinces have invoked Quebec as an example of how to get concessions from Ottawa.So what constitutes a ""nation,"" or ""nation within Canada"" status?It can mean different things, according to experts. But in the Canadian context, and when used by politicians such as Moe, it usually means being culturally distinct in some way through language or a shared history. Generally, it can simply mean a subsection of a population.Feelings of Western alienation have been simmering for years, of course, renewed by the 2014 crash in oil prices and the recent rise of the Liberal party federally, beginning in 2015.Experts who spoke to the Star, however, said Quebec has a long cultural history as well as the French language buttressing its desire for more autonomy from the rest of the country.In May, Quebec brought forward proposed language reforms that would unilaterally change the constitution of Canada. Known as Bill 96, the legislation seeks to amend the country's supreme law to enshrine Quebec's status as a nation and its official language as French. In 2006, former prime minister Stephen Harper recognized Quebec as a nation within Canada, with the support of Parliament.Saskatchewan may have a tougher argument to make when it comes to being culturally distinct and in need of more autonomy from the federal government, McIntosh said.""I've yet to see what the evidence is to support that.""Daniel Béland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, said Moe is ""emulating Jason Kenney"" and his recent push for autonomy in Alberta.Alberta, under Kenney, has for years dangled the prospect of booting out the RCMP to establish its own provincial police force; pulling out of the Canada Pension Plan to launch an Alberta one; and sparking constitutional negotiations, all in the name of winning more autonomy.Moe has pulled some pages from Kenney's playbook, saying that Saskatchewan would also look at policing, as well as immigration, the energy sector and taxation as ways to loosen the shackles of confederation.Policies to achieve the kind of autonomy being suggested - especially around taxation and policing - could be expensive.""Doing this - creating these institutions, say having your own provincial police force and having your own distinct social programs and so forth - all these policies cost money,"" Béland said. ""It's not clear that people are on board.""Setting up a provincial police force would be costly, McIntosh said. (It could get awkward, too, given that the RCMP's training centre is in Saskatchewan.)Taxation is doable - Quebec has its own tax system, noted McIntosh - but that would also be expensive. People in Saskatchewan could end up having to file two income tax forms instead of just one and the province would have to take up paying the infrastructure bill that Ottawa currently covers.""I'm not sure what the political attractiveness of that is,"" he said.""The question,"" Béland added, is ""whether these two premiers will put the money where their mouth is.""Béland pointed to data released by Viewpoint Alberta, a team of researchers that polled residents of Alberta and Saskatchewan on whether they see their respective provinces as ""a culturally distinct society.""Of 800 people surveyed online in March, it found 37 per cent of Albertans and 42 per cent of people in Saskatchewan thought so. However, it also found that 54 per cent in both provinces saw Quebec as having a distinct cultural identity.Among conservatives in the West is an idea that Quebec was able to score points with the federal government while nationalism reared its head there and a widespread desire to separate was at a fever pitch, said McIntosh.""What they don't realize is that, yes, Quebec has been afforded some sort of asymmetrical authority within the federation, but it's because those claims to nationhood rest on something deeper and more profound than, 'We just want more goodies from Ottawa,'"" he said.""To the extent that Quebec got more goodies from Ottawa, it was a byproduct of a nationalist sentiment that's rooted in language and culture.""As for why Moe is beating the drum for Saskatchewan autonomy, McIntosh thinks the reasons are twofold. Moe has a leg to stand on when he criticizes Trudeau for a lack of consultation prior to his announcement, he said.But the headline-grabbing comments could also be getting thrown out now as a distraction from the province's COVID-19 crisis.Critics have slammed Moe for his response to soaring case numbers in recent months as hospitals have faced intense pressure. Meanwhile, thousands of medical procedures in the province have been postponed.""It's an attempt to change the channel in the province,"" said McIntosh.With files from The Canadian Press",Copyright 2021 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd.

United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland",By Jon Hebditch,,,,Scots farmer left starving cow 'oozing pus' in field meaning animal had to be shot,"A Scots farmer who left a starving cow in such a terrible state it had to be shot to death in a field has been blasted byanimalwelfare bosses.David Dalling of Whiteside Farm, Bathgate, was charged under the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 for failing to seek veterinary treatment for thecow's 'clearly debilitated condition'.He appeared at Livingston SheriffCourtyesterday and was ordered to pay £900.The Scottish SPCA have hit out at the sentence saying the 'awful' conditions lead to the cow having to be shot in the field.A shocked bypasser had discovered the animal and raised the alarm to the charity.Heartbroken Scots family pay tribute to 'thoughtful boy' killed by train trying to save animal from tracksInspector June Chalcroft gave harrowing details of the condition of the 'extremely emaciated' beast which had a face 'oozing pus'.She said: ""We were alerted to the cow after passers-by spotted the animal in the field and became concerned about her condition.""They had first seen the cow the previous evening and grew worried when she was still in the same position the following day.""The cow was in an appalling state. She was extremely emaciated and her feet were so overgrown she was only able to stand for a few minutes at a time.""There was a huge swelling on the right side of her face which was burst and oozing pus and several more lumps down the cow's throat.Lyons crime clan associate found dead in jail cell weeks after prison 'attack' by inmate""She was making a gurgling noise and was obviously in a huge amount of discomfort.""It's likely the swelling on her face and throat was preventing her from being able to eat properly.""It would have taken some time for the animal to get in to this condition and her feet alone showed it's unlikely she'd seen a vet for at least six months.""She added: ""The amount of pain and suffering caused to cow would have been considerable.""While the decision was made to euthanise the cow, Chalcroft said treatment earlier could have saved her life.General In Your Area WidgetShe said: ""Sadly, the condition of the cow was so poor the decision was made on veterinary advice that the kindest thing to do would be to euthanise her to prevent further suffering.""However, in the time it took myself and the vet to return to our vehicles to obtain the medication to euthanise the cow, a man entered the field and shot her.""Had the cow been seen by a veterinary surgeon, all of the conditions could have been treated and her welfare could have been considerably better.Police thank thousands who descended on COP26 in Glasgow for 'positive experience'""The multiple tumours, weight loss and overgrown hooves were all potentially treatable and she need not have suffered as a result of such poor husbandry.""We are extremely disappointed that Mr Dalling has only received a fine on this occasion as we do not feel this reflects the suffering caused to the cow over a period of months.""We hope he will be more conscientious in future about ensuring any animal he owns receives the appropriate husbandry and veterinary care required.""Top news stories todayIf anyone is concerned about an animal, they can contact the Scottish SPCA's confidential animal helpline on 03000 999 999.Don't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign up to our daily newsletter.",Copyright 2021 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper; Web Publication|WEBDAR|ENGLISH|ANIMAL WELFAREANIMALSMAMMALSNEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWSSHOOTINGSCRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT & CORRECTIONSDEATH & DYINGEUTHANASIASTARVATIONPRISONSNEGATIVE NEWSCORRECTIONSPRISONERSCHARITIES|VETERINARY SERVICES|SCOTLAND",

There are different membership categories and we're assessing which one would best suit our circumstances if we did choose to join.'The first minister stressed she wants to end Scotland's reliance on fossil fuels 'as fast as possible', but in a way that does not leave 100,000 oil and gas workers 'on the economic scrapheap'.However, her decision not to sign up to the alliance immediately was criticised by Friends of the Earth Scotland.Its director Richard Dixon said: 'Nicola Sturgeon is keen to use the language of climate justice and be photographed with Greta Thunberg. But at some point her fine rhetoric has to translate into a commitment to stop the oil and gas production driving the climate crisis.'Refusing to join the alliance is a failure to follow through on her government's recent change of position to no longer support unlimited oil and gas extraction.'Ms Sturgeon denied being at Cop26 for selfies during interviews with journalists yesterday. After appearing alongside Ugandan climate activist Vanessa Nakate, she said: 'I haven't had many selfies, I don't have a new best, best friend.'The reason I'm sitting here with Vanessa is I recognise people like me, our feet do need to be held to the fire.'",Copyright 2021 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

What we don't know, on the evidence, was whether the manual pressure to the neck continued after unconsciousness.""We don't know if it even occurred up to the point of unconsciousness, we don't know when unconsciousness occurred.""Lady Justice Macur, sitting with Lady Justice Carr and Mr Justice Murray  declined the Attorney General's request to refer the sentence.""We find on the basis of the facts in this case, on the evidence and not speculation... that there was no error of law which can be identified in terms of the assessment of the judge as being irrational or perverse,"" Lady Justice Macur said.""We do not accept the submission of Madam Attorney General that the judge fell into error by considering the starting point in this case to be identified... as one of six years,"" she continued.Lady Justice Macur agreed with the sentencing judge that ""the nature of the evidence was such that it would not be possible to expect a jury to convict this offender of murder"" and there was no evidence capable of proving that Pybus intended to kill or cause really serious harm to Ms Moss.The judge also added that the evidence suggested Ms Moss had consented to the practice of erotic asphyxiation.""The evidence before the court, and that is independent of the offender, suggests that her participation in that practice was consensual and also initiated by her,"" Lady Justice Macur said, adding that her consent was not enough to be a defence to manslaughter.Lady Justice Macur said Ms Moss's death ""has left a great loss to those who loved her"".The judge concluded: ""Bearing all the circumstances of this case in mind, we are not persuaded that the judge was wrong in categorisation, was wrong in the uplift he applied... or was wrong in the element of discount that he gave for mitigation and then for his plea of guilty.""After the ruling, Ms Braverman said: ""There cannot be any guarantees with how a court will decide any matter, and I referred the sentence to the Court of Appeal because I considered it to be too low.""The Court of Appeal decided otherwise, I'm disappointed with the outcome but I respect the judgment and I'm grateful to the courts for considering the matter in some detail.""It's undeniable that this was a tragic case, a disturbing sequence of events in which Sophie Moss lost her life at the hands of the offender.""This government is committed to supporting women and girls through the criminal justice system and preventing them from suffering in broader criminal matters.""We're here to support victims and that's our priority.""

604,SNP pledge is 'PR stunt',"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Scottish Daily Mail,News,238,NEWS;Pg. 19,238,"Scotland
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland",Rachel Watson,,FRIENDS OF THE EARTH,FRIENDS OF THE EARTH,SNP pledge is 'PR stunt',"NICOLA Sturgeon has been accused of a PR stunt after announcing an extra £12million for international aid while domestic projects suffer.Green groups joined the criticism as the First Minister attended Cop26 yesterday. The Scottish Government has pledged an additional £12million to the climate justice fund, on top of £24million promised after the initial fund was doubled.But Tory MSP Stephen Kerr said: 'It is hugely insulting to local councils and campaign groups, which have worked hard and often failed to secure ScotGov funding for vital projects, that the SNP can so easily find millions to generate good PR.'It came as Miss Sturgeon stopped short of joining a coalition to set targets for phasing out fossil fuel production. The Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance was launched by Denmark and Costa Rica, with France, Greenland, Ireland, Sweden, Wales and the Canadian province Quebec signing up.Friends of the Earth Scotland director Richard Dixon said: 'Refusing to join the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance is a failure to follow through on her Government's recent change of position to no longer support unlimited oil and gas extraction.'Miss Sturgeon said negotiations about joining are ongoing due to Scotland's long history of fossil fuel extraction. She stressed she wants to end the country's reliance on fossil fuels 'as fast as possible', but in a way that does not leave workers in the sector 'on the economic scrapheap'.",Copyright 2021 Associated Newpapers Ltd.

605,Strewth!,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Australian,News,1059,THENATION;Pg. 2,1059,Australia,ALICE WORKMAN,,,,Strewth!,"Blowing in the wind Pour one out for the Independent Scientific Committee on Wind Turbines. As we say goodbye to Glasgow, Strewth is sad to report that one of the last ""scientific"" legacies of the Abbott administration is also bidding adieu in December. Cast your mind back to the breezy time Tony Abbott decried wind turbines as ""visually awful"" and his treasurer Joe Hockey called the blades around Lake George, which he passed on his drive down the Federal Highway from North Sydney to Canberra, as ""utterly offensive"" and a ""blight on the landscape"". In order to slash the Renewable Energy Target, the Abbott government needed to secure the votes of the Senate crossbench - including veterinarian David Leyonhjelm, who compared ""Big Wind"" to ""Big Tobacco"". In exchange for their support, then environment minister Greg Hunt agreed to created the four-person, taxpayer-funded committee. It wasn't officially established until after Malcolm Turnbull took over in October 2015, and it was Prime Minister Scott Morrison who extended its term by three years in 2018. Chaired by RMIT adjunct professor John Davy, a leading acoustics researcher, the all-male group of experts was tasked with advising the government on the potential health and environmental impacts of wind turbine sound. That's despite the National Health and Medical Research Council finding no convincing evidence of health effects associated with so-called ""wind turbine syndrome"".Huge metal fans Over the past six years, the work of the Independent Scientific Committee on Wind Turbines was repeatedly rejected by research journals. Its three published papers conclusively proved little more than the annoyance of the anti-wind farm army. Figures from the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources obtained by Strewth show the committee has met 26 times in six years and charged taxpayers a total of $109,639 - nearly a fifth of the $500k the government budgeted in 2015. In its first year, it met once, but charged taxpayers $14,718. It held four telephone meetings and one face-to-face in 2016; seven video conferences in 2017 as it ""proved impossible to have a face-to-face meeting""; six in 2018; three in 2019; three in 2020; and just one this year. Members are paid by the day for ""meetings, preparation and reading""- $1143 per day for the chair and $763 per day for the other three men. Energy Minister Angus Taylor's office informed this columnist that the ""committee is due to conclude in December 2021"" â€¦ unless can-do capitalist ScoMo decides it could help him solve climate change.Clear the air ""Might be a good time for the member for Mallee (Anne Webster, Nationals) to give the Wind Farm Commissioner a call to fact-check her claim that wind turbines don't work in the dark,"" Greens leader Adam Bandt said.Top spin What about the wind farm tsar? Andrew Dyer, former chair of the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman Council, was appointed as Australia's first National Wind Farm Commissioner in October 2015. Taxpayers have forked out over half a million dollars a year to monitor and investigate complaints about the wind industry, with a total to date of $3.38m. This includes travel to meet with concerned residents, IT, office space and Dyer's three-person staff - consisting of an executive officer, complaints officer and admin assistant. The Industry Department did not respond to questions, but Strewth understands Dyer's salary is bigger than the $211k earned by federal backbenchers. The Wind Farm Commissioner was originally responsible for resolving complaints and issues about wind projects â€¦ such as bird deaths. (Side note: a wind farm in northwest Tasmania is trialling a new method of reducing flying fatalities - painting every third turbine blade black. A Norwegian study found this simple solution cut bird deaths by more than 70 per cent!). Hunt diverted around $2m from the Clean Energy Regulator to pay for the office when it was created. Dyer's role has been beefed up over time to include managing community concerns about large-scale solar and storage installation, batteries, and poles and wires needed in big electricity transmission projects. To reflect this, Dyer scored a new title earlier this year - the Australian Energy Infrastructure Commissioner. And he's not going anywhere soon. In the latest budget, the government committed $3m to fund the office for another four years, until October 31, 2025. Spooky.COP that Today host Allison Langdon: ""It's very strange hearing a Coalition leader put climate change front and centre of an election. Electric cars. Do you think we'll see any more of Bill Shorten's policies in the lead up to the election?"" PM: ""Well, it all depends if he tries and rolls Anthony Albanese, I suppose."" Langdon: ""Nice come back.""You little rippa Speaking of reducing emissions â€¦ did Joe Biden let off a little natural gas while he was chatting with Camilla Parker Bowles at COP26? During a reception at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery last week, the leader of the free world reportedly had a lengthy episode of flatulence in the presence of the Duchess of Cornwall. Prince Charles, Prince William and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson were within ear shot. One unnamed source told the Daily Mail that Parker Bowles ""hasn't stopped talking"" about the fart, which was described as ""long"" and ""loud"" and also ""impossible to ignore"". Biden turns 79 next Saturday, which may explain why the man nicknamed ""Sleepy Joe"" by Donald Trump appeared to doze off during the Glasgow summit's opening address. The White House declined to comment on the presidential wind. Shame.Snakes alive Thoughts and prayers for Lucy, the cavoodle owned by LNP MP Warren Entsch, who is recovering from a snake bite. ""Big shout to the amazing team at Tableland Veterinary Service in Malanda for saving my little girl's life,"" Entsch said after the scare earlier this week. And to think we've been wasting time worrying about the possibility of snakes on a plane when engineers dust off the hundreds of aircraft that have been parked in the Alice Springs desert during the pandemic! Entsch's office in Cairns assures Strewth that Lucy will pull through. Fingers crossed she's back on her feet when Entsch hits the hustings for the ninth time.

606,Strong case for more investment in forestry,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Irish Times,News,767,FINANCE;Pg. 1,767,Ireland,John FitzGerald,,,,Strong case for more investment in forestry,"On some of the specimen trees in Fernhill Park, Dún Laoghaire Rathdown Council has labelled the amount of carbon they store. A very fine Giant Redwood there has sequestered 7.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide, equivalent to over half the average annual emissions per person of greenhouse gases in Ireland. It has, however, taken over 100 years for this tree to reach maturity.This example of what a single tree can absorb, albeit a particularly large one, illustrates the potential that afforestation offers to tackle climate change. The agreement at Cop26 to tackle deforestation, however loose it may be, reflects the important capacity of trees to offset fossil fuel emissions. When forest cover is reduced, as is happening in the Amazon, greenhouse gases are emitted as trees are cut down and burned. To make a net difference to climate change, we need not only to replace this lost resource, but also to expand the overall extent of forest coverage. Because much of Europe already has quite extensive forestry, there is limited capacity to expand such cover. However, here in Ireland, we still have plenty of potential to build back the forestry we lost to shipbuilding and barrel staves in the 17th century. The Climate Change Advisory Council's research suggests we could remove 100 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by 2050 through expanding forestry, combined with measures such as rewetting bogs. To achieve this, we would need to expand the planting programme well beyond what is currently taking place. Mature harvest Such new forestry would still only constitute a small share of agricultural land. This work should start immediately, as it takes time before young trees begin to suck up carbon. Carbon dioxide in 2050 is priced at EUR 256 a tonne in the Public Expenditure Guidelines, reflecting the vital importance of ending greenhouse gas emissions. That price would value new afforestation up to 2050, sequestering 100 million tonnes of carbon, at over EUR 25 billion. When trees are harvested at maturity, the effect on atmospheric greenhouse gases depends on what happens to the timber. If it is burned, the carbon sequestered over the life of the trees is released into the atmosphere. But if replanting replaces what has been cut down, then the carbon released is offset over the lifetime of the new trees. However, if the cut timber is used to build homes, then the carbon remains fixed for a further 50 to 100 years, adding to the value of our forests. Most Irish homes are built from cement blocks. About 6 per cent of Irish greenhouse gas emissions come from cement, and these emissions are technically difficult to abate. Ramping up our housebuilding programme is likely to increase those emissions, unless we change how we build. In the US and most of Europe, houses, and even some apartments, are largely built with timber. Traditionally, that was favoured as a cheaper and faster way to build, not for environmental reasons. Cheap and fast housing If we were to adopt these tried-and-tested timber-based construction methods, we would reduce emissions from cement, and sequester carbon for longer in our forest products. In the long run, it could make for cheaper and faster housing. A win-win.For these benefits to be realised, there would have to be a commitment to timber-based technology. Our builders and their teams would need training in alternative building methods, based on assembly of prefabricated panels. We would need to build new factories to create the required precision timber-based panels. Housing for All was silent on timber-framed housing, but the Department of Housing needs to take a leadership role on this. The Land Development Agency could help drive such a change in technology via its role in the social housing building programme.The policy obstacles to reaping the major environmental benefits from forestry need to be tackled. Coillte should have an expanded mandate to drive afforestation at scale. This was inhibited by a court case in the 1990s on state aids. Europe might be encouraged to revisit this restriction in the light of the climate crisis. The Government needs to replace the current licensing regime, which is preventing forest development, with a regulatory regime run by the Environmental Protection Agency. That regime should set appropriate standards, leaving farmers and foresters free to get on with planting trees, and harvesting them when mature. If we want farmers to plant more trees, they need to know they will be able to harvest and replant in due course, so they will have the incentive to do so today.",Copyright 2021 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved,,Newspaper|ENGLISH|CLIMATE CHANGECLIMATOLOGYEMISSIONSGREENHOUSE GASESCARBON CAPTURE & STORAGEDEFORESTATIONFORESTRY & ENVIRONMENTFORESTS & WOODLANDSSHIPBUILDING|EMISSIONSFORESTRY & LOGGINGRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTIONDEFORESTATIONFORESTRY & ENVIRONMENTLOGGING INDUSTRYENERGY & UTILITIESSHIPBUILDING|IRELANDEUROPEUNITED STATES,

An SNP source told The Herald: ""The fact this was briefed to three Tory-supporting newspapers, with only Tories actually claiming it happened says it all. Drew and David were not drunk.""They arrived at 16.45, and they were at a reception at 6.30pm. They were in bed by 10.30pm or so that evening, and in fact two Tory MPs stayed out on the lash until 2am.?""They've not missed any events, and have not even talked to those who have suddenly made these claims. It is a disgusting political smear on the eve of Armistice Day. The Tories?cannot sink any lower.""?The Manchester Evening News later named one of the 2am Tories as Bury MP Christian Wakeford. On social media, Mr Linden said he was ""incredibly disappointed by what appears to be a bizarre Tory smear campaign in the media, but I'll leave the politics to others"".He added: ""Instead, I'll continue to focus on participating in briefings with service personnel, meetings with local officials, as well as continuing to undertake training exercises and hear first hand from those who serve in the Armed Services here in Gibraltar.""Mr Hendry tweeted: ""It's deeply disappointing that Tory MPs have made false claims in a shameless attempt to divert attention from the Tory corruption scandal engulfing Westminster.

611,Succession's hypocrisy is close to real life,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Aberdeen Press and Journal,News,745,AGD;Pg. 27,745,Scotland,Kirstin Innes,,,,Succession's hypocrisy is close to real life,"Like almost everyone I know, I'm hooked on the new series of Succession, the TV drama starring Brian Cox.He plays Logan Roy, the familiar-seeming doyen of his own right-leaning media empire and patriarch of a family so reprehensibly wealthy that their creator describes money as ""just the oxygen they swim in"".The writing is sharp, incisive and shot through with the sort of jet black laugh lines that hit deep.These people are ridiculous, in their tastefully minimal glass-fronted penthouses, playing profanity-splattered power games with their billions, but it's all too easy to feel yourself drawn in to the corporate cut and thrust, compelled to root for whichever spectacularly awful sibling is knifing the others in the back that week.When I first started watching the show, the lives of the very, very rich were so very, very far away from my own as to make the experience escapism.

614,Super-cold?' It's all in the head says Scottish infectious diseases expert,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Herald Scotland,News,661,,661,Scotland,Caroline Wilson,,,,Super-cold?' It's all in the head says Scottish infectious diseases expert,"IT has left some bed bound and experiencing debilitating symptoms for weeks including earache, fatigue, loss of appetite and a sore throat.However, a Scots scientist says there is no evidence that a ""super-cold"" is doing the rounds despite protestations that this year's seasonal viruses are worse than ever.Professor Neil Mabbot, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Edinburgh, said the seemingly worse symptoms may be just attributable to forgetting what it's like to be unwell after a year without colds and flu.He said the absence of most viruses last year due to rigorous Covid mitigations had led to waning immunity and had effectively turned adults into children this year with a higher susceptibility to bugs.""It's the buzz-word that's going around but I don't think we have any evidence there is a super-cold or super-flu going around,"" he said.READ MORE: COP26 delegates urged to 'respect Glasgow' and stop discarding test kits""Essentially it's the way our bodies are responding to the circulating cold. It will be working on multiple levels, one of which is that we've had so little exposure that immunity we build up will have waned.""We've also forgotten what it's likely to have a cold. It's a shock. I can't remember the last time I had one, so far I've managed to dodge it.""Colds for most people are just a nuisance and in a normal healthy person would last two weeks, maybe three maximum. Sore throat, runny nose but with time they start to alleviate.""That's in a normal situation but we haven't had much cold circulating\xC2and what that's doing is we develop an immune response to the cold that's going around at that time and that helps to provide a little bit of protection the next time a cold comes around.""However, with some symptoms such as a sore throat and sneezing echoing those experienced by people affected by the Covid Delta variant he said regular testing was crucial.He said colds were far more transmissible from surface contact than coronavirus.""Simply using a door handle or lift button might be sufficient to transmit that cold or flu.""It's important that people don't just say 'oh it's just a cold' and get tested.""He said research is ongoing to try to establish how cold and flu viruses\xC2interact with coronavirus.""That's what scientists are looking at now. Does having flu make you more susceptible to having coronavirus? I think there is some evidence for the flu that might affect the outcome of coronavirus but we aren't sure about colds themselves.\xC2READ MORE: Highlanders urged to stop hand-feeding deer amid concern about attacks and serious illness caused by ticks""The interaction between these pathogens is certainly an interesting area.""A new study has found that previous, recent\xC2exposure to the common cold could provide some protection against Covid-19 by helping the body to eliminate the virus before it starts to replicate.Researchers from University College London (UCL) looked at NHS workers who were at high risk of infection during the early part of the pandemic but had not fallen ill and developed no protective anti-bodies.They found that, in fact, they had been infected but they were protected by their T-cells, which can destroy infected cells.""This new study which came out yesterday (Wednesday) suggests that in some people, memory T cells induced in response to infection with seasonal coronaviruses can provide protection against the coronavirus that causes Covid-19,"" said Prof Mabbott.""These T cells recognise an internal feature of the coronavirus rather than the virus spike protein that is used in the Covid-19 vaccines. \xC2""So this new information could be used to design new vaccines to provide cross-protection against a range of coronaviruses. \xC2""It is important to note that there are many other different types of virus that can cause colds in addition to other coronaviruses, and immunity from infection with those viruses would be unlikely to have the same effect.""",Copyright 2021 NewsQuest Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|COMMON COLDDISEASES & DISORDERSINFECTIOUS DISEASECORONAVIRUSESCOVID CORONAVIRUSEAR, NOSE & THROAT DISORDERSINFLUENZAVIRUSESDISEASE IMMUNITYIMMUNOLOGYCOVID-19 CORONAVIRUSCHILDRENCOLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS|IMMUNOLOGYCOLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS|EDINBURGH, SCOTLANDGLASGOW, SCOTLAND|SCOTLAND",

629,There may be other threats to humanity that are being ignored,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Irish News,News,456,A6F0,456,Ireland,,,,,There may be other threats to humanity that are being ignored,"Archaeologists are creatures of habit, and as such they habitually record on archaeological drawings the orientation of buildings in relation to magnetic north at the time of excavation.During research towards the Early Byzantine Christian Church, the orientation of churches in the Levant in relation to magnetic north, as recorded on archaeological drawings, was noted together with the Byzantine date, if any, provided by inscriptions in mosaic pavements.This data provides some evidence that new-build churches constructed within a few years of each other share the same orientation, and that through time the alignment of new-build churches changes in concert.Why would new-build churches act in concert this way?A number of texts indicate that it fell to the local bishop to lay out the plan for new church buildings, and the alignment would be determined by the ‘finger of God’.It is a working assumption that this refers to a magnetic compass, and, indeed, there is a contemporary sixth century reference from Procopius of Caesarea to sailing vessels relying on a magnetic compass to navigate at sea.The working hypothesis then is that the orientation of new-build churches during the Early Byzantine period records the direction of magnetic north at the time of construction, and so each of these church buildings arguably serves as a palaeomagnetic record of the wandering magnetic north pole over time.If this working hypothesis is correct then this record can augment evidence in Duff (Holmes’ Principles of Physical Geography, 1994, chapter 27) that the magnetic north pole has staggered around during the last 500 years of recorded history, and on occasions the Earth’s magnetic poles have completely reversed, as happened 20,000 years ago.In the chapter ‘Chandler wobbles, tilts, and wanders’ (‘The man from MENSA’- 1 of 600) this working hypothesis is expanded upon, and it is argued that the Earth’s magnetic poles are merely reacting to periodic reversals of the Sun’s magnetic poles, which have been observed flip-flopping every 10 years or so.In simple terms, if the working hypothesis is correct, then the archaeological record referred to above suggests that the Earth’s magnetic north pole was located in the vicinity of Japan during the sixth century, and well on its way to a full reversal, before moving back to the geographical North Pole again.Of course this working hypothesis has to be tested before any conclusions can be reached, but there is a coincidental global cooling event during A.D. 536 that warrants further research – among others.The focus of COP26 in Glasgow is firmly on preventing global warming, but there may be other threats to humanity that are being ignored.DR BERNARD MULHOLLANDBelfast BT9",Copyright 2021 The Irish News Limited All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|ANTHROPOLOGY & ARCHAEOLOGYARCHAEOLOGYRELIGIONCHRISTIANS & CHRISTIANITYHUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCERELIGIOUS FACILITIESGEOGRAPHYHISTORYGLOBAL WARMING|NEW CONSTRUCTIONMARINE VESSELSGLOBAL WARMING|BELFAST, NORTHERN IRELANDGLASGOW, SCOTLAND",
630,These Investors May Believe Biden on Inflation;DealBook Newsletter,"November 12, 2021 Friday",New York,The New York Times,News,1935,BUSINESS;dealbook,1935,,"Andrew Ross Sorkin, Jason Karaian, Sarah Kessler, Stephen Gandel, Michael J. de la Merced, Lauren Hirsch and Ephrat Livni",,COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS,COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS,These Investors May Believe Biden on InflationDealBook Newsletter,"Has the president found a corner of the market that has faith in his pledge to contain rising prices?Ups and downsA big part of President Biden’s pitch for his $1.85 trillion social and climate policy plan is that it would lower inflation. That would be welcome, after the latest government data showed that consumer prices rose 6.2 percent, the highest inflation in more than 30 years. Critics say that generous stimulus measures are to blame for rising prices, and more spending will make inflation even worse.But the White House believes that provisions in the spending plan, like providing money for child care to help parents re-enter a tight labor market, could help lower prices. “If anything, these measures push back on inflationary pressures,” Jared Bernstein, a member of Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers, told The Times.The White House is having trouble making its case. As a general rule, government spending tends to bolster economic growth, and, as a result, inflation. Republicans and centrist Democrats have pointed to already high inflation as a reason to scale back or nix the Biden administration’s proposed plan. A wide range of economists, including a forecasting firm the White House regularly cites, believe that Biden’s plan will increase inflation, at least over the next year, The Times’s Jeanna Smialek and Jim Tankersley report.But the bond market isn’t pricing in runaway inflation. The difference between the interest rate on a typical government bond to the yield on similar bonds that offer protection against inflation, called the break-even rate, is a gauge of investors’ expectations for inflation. Right now, that rate for five-year Treasury bonds is 3.1 percent, or about half October’s actual rate of inflation. The rate for 10-year bonds is even lower, at 2.7 percent. (Mind you, those rates are still above the Fed’s target of 2 percent average inflation over time.)What does it mean? Bond investors have generally bet that inflation will rise over time. Just before the pandemic, the five-year break-even rate was 1.6 percent, and the 10-year was higher, at 1.7 percent. A decade ago, it was 1.8 percent and 2.1 percent. Directionally, that bond investors now expect high inflation to moderate over time, despite Biden’s big spending plans, means that either bond investors are skeptical the bill will pass, that they think the Fed will act to contain inflation if passes, or that they are buying what Biden is selling.HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING J.&amp;J. unveils a breakup plan. Days after G.E. said it would split itself up, the health products giant is following a similar route by spinning off its slower-growing consumer productions business from its pharmaceutical and medical device operations. Separately, Toshiba also said it would break itself into three businesses.AstraZeneca will begin making money from its coronavirus vaccine. The drugmaker has signed its first deals to sell doses for a profit, though it will still sell to low-income countries at cost. This moves AstraZeneca closer to rivals like Pfizer and Moderna, whose vaccine revenues have been significantly higher.Climate reparations take center stage at COP26. As the U.N. climate summit nears its end, negotiations have focused on whether richer countries should compensate poorer ones for climate damage and help pay for their transition to low-emission economies. One issue of concern for the U.S. is shielding wealthier nations from legal liability.Britain’s economy limps through the pandemic. The country’s G.D.P. rose just 1.3 percent in the third quarter, as the government cited supply-chain shortages as well as migration and trade changes resulting from Brexit. Other data shows the British economy underperforming other countries, while suffering worse inflation.Alibaba’s big shopping event shows a huge slowdown. Sales during the Chinese e-commerce giant’s Singles Day rose 8.5 percent over last year, to nearly $85 billion worth of merchandise, down from a 26 percent year-on-year jump in 2020. Possible contributors include supply-chain shortages and keeping a lower profile as Beijing cracks down on the company.What C.E.O.s really think about returning to the officeA year and a half into the pandemic, C.E.O.s are grappling with flexible and hybrid office arrangements, now and in the future. They want to appeal to employees who relish more autonomy about where they work, but are reluctant to give up too much control. Several bosses spoke with The Times’s David Gelles about how, or whether, to get workers back to the office.On what workers want …“Why should I, as an employer, care as long as you can get the work done and you’re highly productive?” said Arvind Krishna, IBM’s C.E.O. He no longer worries about when workers show up to the office for work, so long as they are productive.On the benefits of returning to the office …“We’re going to be able to do a better job if we’re together,” said Chris Merrill, the C.E.O. of the asset management firm Harrison Street. “It’s very, very important for the younger people to be together. That is where they learn. That is where they grow. That is where you’re going to create upward mobility.” Employees of the firm have been back at the office five days a week since Labor Day.On the benefits of working remotely …“We basically just listened to the work force, and everybody said remote work was working really well,” said Hayden Brown, the C.E.O. of Upwork. The technology company’s Chicago headquarters has opened, closed when the Delta variant surged and recently reopened for workers to go in — if they want to.“These people are exhausted and really need to have a life — and that’s why they are quitting.”— Claudio Antonini, a career coach for investment bankers, on Wall Streeters joining the wave of people quitting their jobs. Antonini said his clients were fed up with being unable to date or have social lives, while some were simply job-hopping in response to huge paychecks being offered by banks to attract staff.What we learned about Musk’s stock salesElon Musk sold billions of dollars worth of Tesla’s stock this week, and, befitting his unorthodox style, he did it while generating as much intrigue (and controversy) as possible.The background: Last weekend, Musk polled his Twitter followers about whether he should sell 10 percent of his roughly $200 billion in Tesla stock. The verdict: Yes. Tesla’s stock promptly dropped on Monday and Tuesday. On Wednesday, Musk disclosed that he had sold, in various transactions, 4.5 million shares worth about $5 billion. Of those, about a million shares were sold based on a prearranged plan from September, months before the Twitter poll, to cover taxes on the exercise of nearly 2.2 million options that were set to expire next year. (He still owns roughly 20 million options that will expire in August.)What we learned: First, Musk did indeed have a big tax bill coming, and he sold $1.1 billion worth of shares to satisfy those obligations. Second, the Twitter poll that resulted in Tesla’s shares dropping 16 percent looks to have cost Musk tens of millions of dollars because he sold at a lower price. Third, the poll also cost the I.R.S. because it cut Musk’s capital gains on the stock he acquired through options.The legal and policy implications: Shareholders may raise questions about manipulation, given that Musk’s Twitter poll appeared to send Tesla’s stock tumbling before a preplanned stock sale. But a case for securities fraud would be tough because Musk was one of the losers in the trade (and he is unlikely to sue). This all began with Musk making a point about proposed taxes on unrealized capital gains, and the subsequent twists could strengthen President Biden’s argument about taxing the ultrawealthy in different ways.In the papersSome of the academic research that caught our eye this week, summarized in one sentence:•The proportion of women graduating with economics degrees in recent years has stagnated, and that affects the way policies are made. (Rigissa Megalokonomou, Marian Vidal-Fernandez and Duygu Yengin)•A.I. is good for autocrats — and autocrats are good for A.I. (Martin Beraja, Andrew Kao, David Yang and Noam Yuchtman)•Women face more stress at work because they are better at keeping to deadlines than men. (Ashley Whillans et al.)Is the Supreme Court good for business?Elizabeth Pollman of the University of Pennsylvania says that the Supreme Court under Chief Justice John Roberts has been “pro-business” in the classic sense, issuing decisions that tend to limit corporate liability and expand rights. But this can go against the growing importance of environmental, social and governance issues to investors, employees and executives themselves, creating tension as the notion of what’s good for business shifts, she told DealBook, expanding on arguments she made this week in the Harvard Law Review.E.S.G. “has gone mainstream,” she said, with investors demanding that companies disclose everything from climate impacts to work force diversity to political spending. More shareholder proposals on E.S.G. issues won approval this past proxy season than ever before, yet the court last term tended to go against this trend, Pollman wrote.•The court decided in favor of nonprofits challenging California’s demand to disclose the identities of big donors. This runs counter to growing demands for transparency on political spending, especially so-called dark money.•The court also found in favor of Cargill and Nestlé USA in a case brought by formerly enslaved children in Ivory Coast who were forced to work on farms that supplied the companies. Amid a push for companies to be more aware of who they are doing business with, “how do we actually enforce human rights on the supply chain?” Pollman asked.The S.E.C. may be headed for a showdown at the court. The docket so far this term is light on corporate law and heavy on contentious constitutional issues (guns, abortion, religion). But the S.E.C. has indicated it will issue a new rule on climate-related disclosures soon. It is likely to be challenged and go to the Supreme Court, Pollman believes.THE SPEED READ Deals•“Facebook is quietly buying up the metaverse” (Recode)•How the collapse of Archegos is upending the investment banking industry.

631,The shipping industry faces a climate crisis reckoning - will it decarbonize?,"November 12, 2021 Friday",Non-jurisdictional,The Guardian (London),News,1689,ENVIRONMENT;Version:1,1689,,Maddie Stone,,A P MOELLER-MAERSK A/S,A P MOELLER-MAERSK A/S,The shipping industry faces a climate crisis reckoning - will it decarbonize?,"In August, Maersk, the world's largest shipping company, announced  that it would add eight new container ships to its fleet that would be unlike any merchant vessels operating on the high seas today. Instead of running on ""bunker"" fuel - the gunky, tar-like substance left behind after oil is refined - Maersk plans to power these ships on carbon-neutral methanol, a colorless liquid made from biomass such as agricultural waste or by combining renewably generated hydrogen with carbon dioxide.Globally, very little  of this ""green"" methanol is produced today and compared with the oil industry waste product most ships run on, the cost is high. Maersk hasn't yet announced a fuel supply for its new fleet but the company hopes that standing up the world's first green methanol-powered fleet will spur the energy sector to significantly ramp up production of clean fuels.""Rather than talking about how this can't be done, let's just get started and let's start scaling,"" said Morten Bo-Christiansen, the head of decarbonization at Maersk.It's a small step toward the enormous goal of decarbonizing shipping, an industry that accounts for roughly 3%  of global greenhouse gas emissions and is far off track  from meeting the goals of the Paris climate agreement.Until now, shipping companies, which operate in remote international waters far from the public eye, have managed to avoid meaningful climate regulation. But the industry is facing a reckoning. The US, the EU and other big economies are starting to make pledges  and draw up plans  to green the shipping sector and at Cop26, a coalition of countries including the UK and the US signed a declaration  committing to ""strengthen global efforts"" to reach net zero by 2050.Business leaders are starting to take note. ""Our crews see this as the number one thing on their boardroom agenda now,"" said Guy Platten, the secretary general of the International Chamber of Shipping, a trade association that represents roughly 80% of the world's merchant fleet.                   A huge industry with a huge climate footprint                   The shipping industry is a critical pillar of the global economy, with about 90% of all globally traded goods - from oil and steel to furniture and iPhones - ferried around the world by sea. In order to move all those goods, merchant ships burn approximately 300m metric tons  of dirty fossil fuels each year, emitting roughly 1bn metric tons  of carbon dioxide in the process. That is roughly equivalent to the annual carbon emissions of Japan. The shipping industry will have to eliminate those carbon emissions by 2050  in order to stay in line with the Paris climate agreement's 1.5C global heating target. But between 2012 and 2018, its emissions rose by 10%. The International Maritime Organization (IMO), the UN body that regulates shipping, predicts  that by 2050, the industry's emissions could be 30% higher than they were in 2008.For that to change, tougher regulations are needed. The IMO adopted an initial energy efficiency regulation for ships in 2011 , which set minimum fuel efficiency requirements per mile traveled and another one  this June aimed at reducing the carbon intensity of ships by 40% by 2030.Those standards have ""basically codified a business as usual trend"", says Faïg Abbasov, the shipping program director at the Belgium-based non-profit Transport & Environment. The June measure requires shipping companies to give their vessels an A-E grade on energy efficiency and submit a ""corrective action plan"" for any ships that receive a D or E for three consecutive years. But the scores will not be made public and no mechanism exists to force dirty ships to improve, said Abbasov.In 2018, the IMO set a goal  of cutting the industry's carbon pollution at least in half by 2050. But it hasn't adopted any binding emissions reduction targets or regulations to achieve the target and even if it did, the goal is still far short of what's needed to remain in line with the Paris agreement. Industry observers ascribe this partly to the slow nature of rule-making at the IMO, but also to corporate influence  at the UN agency, where industry representatives are frequently appointed to serve on state delegations.""There's very little doubt"" the shipping industry has stalled IMO climate regulations, said Aoife O'Leary, the CEO of Opportunity Green, a non-profit focused on international climate issues including shipping.                   A patchwork of regulations                   But change appears to be on the horizon. The EU is now moving to regulate shipping emissions under its emissions trading system, with a phase-in beginning in 2023. Under the proposed law , by 2026 shipping companies will need to pay for the carbon they emit traveling to and from the EU and between EU ports.Separately, the EU is proposing  a fuel mandate that would compel the industry to use a progressively greater share of low- and zero-carbon fuels in its ships. And in April, the US committed  to pursuing a zero emissions shipping industry by 2050.While the shipping industry has pushed back against the idea of a patchwork of climate regulations across different nations, O'Leary said these could compel the IMO to take more ambitious action. ""If you look at the history of IMO regulations, they've often acted because the EU or the US have acted on their own,"" she said.The industry does seem more eager to talk about climate. In March, the International Chamber of Shipping proposed  a carbon levy of $2 a metric ton of fuel to go towards research and development of clean shipping technology. This proposal, along with a far more ambitious proposal by the Marshall Islands to tax merchant vessels to the tune of $100 a metric ton  of bunker fuel, will be discussed at an IMO meeting in late November.Platten of the International Chamber of Shipping wouldn't say whether the industry would support the specific fuel tax proposed by the Marshall Islands. But he said that shipping businesses ""welcome the discussion and debate of market-based measures"" to drive down emissions and make low and zero carbon synthetic fuels more economically viable. In October, the ICS called for next zero emissions  for the industry by 2050, doubling the ambitions of the IMO.                   The quest for zero carbon fuel                   Transforming the shipping sector means zero-carbon fuels must become available on a commercial scale, along with the infrastructure required to pump them into ships. Green methanol, ammonia and hydrogen can all be made with renewable energy, in processes that start with splitting water in an electrolyzer to produce hydrogen. But while green methanol can be dropped into existing ships with fairly minimal retrofits, the other two will require significant modifications of ship designs and operational procedures.Ammonia and hydrogen are gases at room temperature and will need refrigerated tanks to store as liquids. Ammonia is also toxic to marine life and humans, raising safety and environmental concerns. Hydrogen, meanwhile, has a very low energy density  compared with oil, which means that ships using it would have to carry much larger volumes of fuel, or be refilled far more often.Proving that alternative fuels are safe and reliable to use on commercial vessels, then scaling them up and deploying them across the global shipping industry will be an expensive and time-consuming endeavor.""What we are really looking at is decades of investment and innovation ahead of us,"" said Bo Cerup-Simonsen, the CEO of the Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping, a research and development center. ""It's fair to say that we're talking billions,"" he said, ""but I think the trillions come when we start to scale this up to become industry wide.""Researchers have estimated  that if zero emissions fuels comprise 5% of the international shipping fuel mix by 2030, the industry will be on a path to fully decarbonize by 2050. The Global Maritime Forum's Getting to Net Zero Coalition believes that target is achievable based on recently announced plans, including the EU's 2020 Hydrogen Strategy , which calls for building at least 40 gigawatts of renewable hydrogen electrolyzers by 2030, as well as China and Japan's goals to ramp up hydrogen fuel production.                   'We're not there just yet'                   While the task ahead is daunting, Cerup-Simonsen is optimistic. The number of large companies expressing interest in carbon-free shipping is growing ""day by day"", he said, as is interest from their customers. ""You're seeing mining companies, some of the big retailers, big auto manufacturers starting to demand a greening of their supply chains, including shipping,"" Cerup-Simonsen said.Large consumer-facing businesses could be key in helping to drive change in the shipping industry, says Madeline Rose, the climate campaign director at Pacific Environment who recently led a report  on the shipping pollution associated with 15 major retail brands, including Amazon, Walmart and Target.In 2019 alone, the report found that these companies were responsible for three coal fired power plants' worth of carbon pollution through their US shipping imports. Despite making ambitious climate pledges in recent years, most of the companies highlighted in the report do not appear to account for marine pollution in their corporate emissions reporting.Amazon, along with companies including Ikea and Unilever, signed a pledge  in October to only move goods on ships using zero carbon fuel by 2040.While retailers demanding cleaner shipping could motivate shipping companies to bring new options online faster, Abbasov of Transport & Environment is doubtful that voluntary corporate pledges will drive transformative change. For now, he says, regulations are needed to make alternative fuels more economically attractive and prevent corporate greenwashing.""Once there are regulations, once the technology has become very common, individual companies can take one extra step and go further than the law says,"" Abbasov said. ""For shipping, we're not there just yet.""","Copyright 2021 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

632,The stench of sleaze and second jobs,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Herald (Glasgow),News,430,Pg. 17,430,Scotland,Victoria Brenan ,,,,The stench of sleaze and second jobs,"THE ongoing sleaze crisis and the issue of second jobs for MPs were the issues raised by columnists in the newspapers.Daily MailHenry Deedes said the press pack was ""pummelling away hard at the Prime Minister about the stench of sleaze emanating from Westminster"" at the COP26 press conference.""Boris stuttered and bumbled, shifting his bodyweight this way,"" he said.""Twice, Boris was given an opportunity to apologise for the steaming mess he'd caused from the Owen Paterson affair. Twice, he declined. ""Instead, he endured a test of 22 minutes, in which he looked about as comfortable as a schoolboy in a hand-knitted Guernsey sweater.""He said each question began with a polite inquiry about the whole COP business. ""That's why we were there, after all,"" he said. ""But those were a mere amuse-bouche before the nitty-gritty. Shades of Lieutenant Columbo tossing a few underarm lobs before going in for the kill. The PM waffled aimlessly. And with that, whoosh! Off he pounded stage left, faster than a rabbit around a dog track.""Daily ExpressStephen Pollard said the whole point of having rules is to ensure that when someone breaks them, there are consequences. ""That's why the current system was set up - because in the 1990s some MPs were getting away with behaviour that was clearly wrong, such as asking questions in the Commons on behalf of a company or body which was paying them, and not making that clear,"" he said. ""But to jump from arguing that because of the behaviour of Owen Paterson and Geoffrey Cox, therefore no MP should ever be allowed to have a second job is illogical, impractical and plain wrong.""It is to the benefit of politics that we have MPs who are experts in a variety of professions and areas, and who maintain that expertise.""The GuardianOwen Jones said being an MP is not a ""job"", it is a public service. "" In exchange for the privilege of representing your community and helping to determine the future direction of your country, you are handed a publicly-funded salary of nearly £82,000, placing you in the top 5% of earners, pulling in around three times the average wage,"" he said. ""That is beyond anything most Britons will ever hope to earn.""Being an MP is a public service and a duty, not a top-end profession requiring appropriate remuneration. But we need to do more than just say it: putting an end to corruption requires urgent reform. That means banning second jobs - with the exceptions of actual public services, such as healthcare or teaching - and heavily constraining the revolving door and the lobbying activities of former MPs.""",Copyright 2021 Newsquest Media Group All Rights Reserved,,Newspaper|HER|ENGLISH|crimewales_communitywales electoral ward|NEGATIVE NEWSWAGES & SALARIESBRITISH PARLIAMENTLOBBYINGPOLITICSWRITERSPRIME MINISTERSELECTORAL DISTRICTSHEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENTPRESS CONFERENCESAVERAGE EARNINGSCORRUPTION|MEDIA & TELECOMMUNICATIONSWRITERS|UNITED KINGDOM,

634,The Tories are known for ruthlessly ditching leaders - Boris Johnson will be looking over his shoulder,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),News,954,"INDEPENDENT PREMIUM,VOICES;Version:1",954,England & Wales,Andrew Grice,,,,The Tories are known for ruthlessly ditching leaders - Boris Johnson will be looking over his shoulder,"""Boris doesn't really believe anything except people like him should be left alone to do what they want,"" one former Boris Johnson  aide told me. Indeed, Johnson has reportedly earned  more than £4m from his outside interests in the past 14 years.Perhaps this helps to explain his woeful mishandling of the Owen Paterson  affair and his reluctance to tighten the MPs ' code of conduct. On Monday, the Commons will formally overturn the ill-fated decision to change the system of investigating complaints against MPs to try to save Paterson's skin. Johnson should use this opportunity to apologise for the fiasco and to support moves to restrict MPs' second jobs -including a ban on acting as parliamentary consultants.But he probably won't. Cabinet ministers including Rishi Sunak, Steve Barclay and Nadhim Zahawi have been much more contrite than Johnson; it is not in his DNA to say sorry. This is compounding the damage to him and his party from a controversy that was his own making.Only a month after seeming all-powerful at the Tory conference, Johnson's standing among Tory MPs has sunk to its lowest level. The public, and the new generation of Tory MPs in the Midlands and North, want tougher rules on MPs' conduct. But Johnson doesn't want to alienate a band of ex-ministers who want to keep their second jobs after losing their ministerial salaries. This awkward squad could make life very difficult for him.Johnson seems to be in denial. The journalist in him believes the media storm will blow itself out, but it has been on the front pages for nine days and shows little sign of abating.  Nadine Dorries, the culture secretary, told Tory MPs on WhatsApp that the 2009 scandal over MPs' expenses was ""a billion times worse"". She conveniently forgot that Labour was in power then and opposition leader David Cameron deflected anger over Tory MPs' expenses by proposing measures to clean up politics.

To keep up to speed with all the latest opinions and comment sign up to our free weekly Voices newsletter by                     clicking hereToday, the return of ""Tory sleaze"" has helped Labour draw level in the opinion polls. Johnson's position among his MPs will worsen if they no longer think he's a winner. He knows his party ruthlessly ditches leaders when it believes they will lose - as Margaret Thatcher, Iain Duncan Smith and Theresa May discovered. As one senior Tory said crudely: ""Boris is there because he is an asset. If he is seen a liability, the game will be up."" His own support among his MPs has always been shallow, leaving him vulnerable to a sudden and dramatic loss of support. We are not at that point yet. But sooner or later, Johnson will need action rather than words to reassure the public he will tighten and uphold the rules. Instead of undermining regulators, he should put parliament's standards commissioner and advisers on the ministerial code and business appointments on a statutory footing. Crucially, he should accept their rulings rather than ignore them. It is remarkable that when Priti Patel was found to have broken the ministerial code after allegedly bullying Home Office officials, she remained in post while the ministerial adviser Alex Allan resigned. (This story is not over yet : a judicial review of Johnson's decision will be heard on 17 November.)The most significant episode in the current controversy came when Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, suggested Kathryn Stone, the parliamentary standards' watchdog, consider her position. That gave the game away. As I reported in April , Johnson feared Stone would investigate how he funded the refurbishment of his Downing Street flat, and she regarded him as ""disrespectful"" of the rules on MPs' registering their interests. The backcloth to the ""save Paterson"" move was a belief among Tories that Stone is biased against them; her critics' favourite example is her harrying MPs, including the then culture minister, Caroline Dineage, for not registering a trip to the Brit awards.  For me, Stone is doing the job parliament asked her to do, without fear or favour. But the strong feelings about her contributed to Johnson's foolish attempt to rescue Paterson. The can of worms he opened exposed flaws in the rules on MPs' second jobs which have allowed Geoffrey Cox, the former attorney general, to earn about £6m as a lawyer since becoming an MP in 2005.The committee on standards in public life, set up by John Major after the original ""Tory sleaze"" scandal, has rightly been calling for tighter controls on MPs' second jobs since the expenses row. In 2018, it proposed: ""MPs should not accept any paid work to provide services as a parliamentary strategist, adviser or consultant."" The committee rejected a time or earnings limit on outside work but proposed it should not prevent them fully undertaking their primary role as an MP, with possible breaches investigated by the standards commissioner. In order to end this sorry saga, Johnson should come out for curbs on second jobs - short of the total ban that would prevent MPs working as doctors and nurses and might deter high calibre people from entering parliament. Much better for Johnson to act quickly now than grudgingly later. And say sorry for the mess he created.

635,"The Tories are taking back control of their party - and Boris Johnson;The Prime Minister is losing absolute power over the Conservatives, and his Government is better for it","November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Daily Telegraph (London),News,1039,NEWS;Pg. 16,1039,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,FRASER NELSON,,,,"The Tories are taking back control of their party - and Boris JohnsonThe Prime Minister is losing absolute power over the Conservatives, and his Government is better for it","When Rishi Sunak admitted that the Government had blundered over the Owen Paterson vote, he was making a bit of a gamble. This is the very apology that Boris Johnson has conspicuously refused to offer. Since becoming Chancellor, Sunak has taken care to be seen as uber-loyal to the Prime Minister, doing his best to conceal the many differences between them. But with the party in crisis - and its leader refusing to express regret - ministers are taking matters into their own hands.As each day passes, Tories have more cause to regret the loyalty showed last week to what they now regard as an incompetent No10. ""The whips are supposed to be the shrewdest among us,"" complains one minister. ""But Boris has made it a nursery for the thickos."" Backbenchers were not even asked about their opinions on the disastrous ""Save Paterson"" plan until the day before the vote - by which time everything had been finalised and it was too late to change direction.Almost all of the 247 Tories who voted to exculpate Paterson did so under duress - but they all assumed No10 knew what it was doing. Few will make that mistake again. The vote not only failed but has exposed all Tories to this week's accusations of sleaze. Every politician with outside interests, from legal advice to football refereeing, is now accused of being on the fiddle. They are fending off the attacks while blaming No10 for starting the fire.As a point of principle, Johnson doesn't do apologies - seeing them as part of a pointless media game. When he became Foreign Secretary he said he would not engage in a ""full global itinerary of apology"" as it would take too long. His parting advice to his successor as Spectator editor was to never admit error, even under pressure. ""Old chums will turn up in your office, urging you to capitulate,"" he wrote. ""Don't. The Spectator surrenders to no one. The Spectator is always right.""He seems to regard politics the same way: if you apologise, you are weakened and they win.But ministers are not waiting for him to change his mind. In offering their own apology, they do not mean that they erred: as everyone now knows, the Paterson plan was very much his idea. They think the Prime Minister was wrong and that his error ought to be acknowledged by others. Nadhim Zahawi, the Education Secretary, has said that ""upon reflection"" it was a mistake. Steve Barclay, the Cabinet Secretary, has apologised on behalf of the Government. The one person who was not even in Parliament when this was being debated was the Prime Minister himself.Johnson has been back in Glasgow for the Cop26 summit, where he has been quite the hit among other national leaders. When asked in one private meeting about the detail of his net zero policy he shrugged and said: ""Detail? Me?""Whether an act or not, his audience loved it. ""Everyone laughed,"" says one foreign delegate. ""He didn't say a single sentence that wasn't funny."" But this is all wearing rather thin in Westminster. ""If he'd actually read that report before he got us to vote, he'd find Owen Paterson guilty as charged,"" says one government member. ""For a lot of people, that will be the last time they go with this.""Andrew Bowie, a Scottish Tory from the 2017 intake, has resigned as a party vice-chairman in dismay at the bungling. The mood in the party is so febrile that one loyal Conservative MP has been suggesting that the Prime Minister has fallen victim to a plot from someone luring him into lunatic positions. But the ideas are all his. A poll for this newspaper shows that his raising taxes to a 71-year high has damaged Tory support even more than the latest sleaze allegations.It is almost impossible to find a single Tory who believes the plan to increase National Insurance is worth the political pain. The policy was rushed through with just one internal poll question, asking if people would like to pay more tax to fix social care. ""If they'd asked further questions - like 'Do you think this extra tax is likely to fix social care?' - they'd have found a better answer,"" says one Tory strategist. This is the fear now: that voters are angrily aware of the tax hike but doubt it will improve things.For his part, Sunak is starting to draw a thin blue line between his politics and Johnson's. His curious Budget speech was divided into the parts done under No 10's orders (the spending) and then his own priorities (cut taxes). He has come as close as he dares to saying: ""Thus far, but no further."" His personal promise to MPs - that he'd use any extra money to cut taxes - was a declaration of his semi-independence and a personal manifesto he must now stick to.Kwasi Kwarteng, the Business Secretary, regularly veers from the government line (sometimes deliberately) and was ruling out a tax rise before it was forced through. Perhaps the boldest of all Cabinet members is Liz Truss, who opposed the tax rise outright when it came to Cabinet - and was shot down by Sunak for her troubles. Should the time come, there will be no shortage of people ready to champion her cause.The anarchy of the Theresa May years almost destroyed the Tory party as it tore itself apart over Brexit. The terror-induced discipline of the Dominic Cummings era was a necessary corrective while a deal with the EU was agreed. Lockdown suspended political life in Westminster (and beyond) and with it the ability of politicians to form groups, compare notes and think how to react. But life is returning to the Commons now, catalysed by last week. Little groups of Tory MPs are wondering how bad things are going to get - and how to stop it.The Prime Minister's personal authority - and that of No10 - will perhaps never recover from the events of the past fortnight. The result will be more independent-minded ministers, a more rebellious party and more people prepared to push back and try to stop Conservatism turning into Johnsonism. For more than two years, his personal power over his party has been almost absolute. That is changing now, and his Government will be the better for it.Follow Fraser Nelson on Twitter @FraserNelson read more at www.telegraph.co.uk/ opinionA Telegraph poll shows raising taxes to a 71-year high has damaged Tory support more than the sleaze allegations",Copyright 2021 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|DTL|ENGLISH|National Edition|HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENTPRIME MINISTERSGOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERSNEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWSPOLITICSNEGATIVE NEWSEDUCATION DEPARTMENTSSTATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICESSPORTS OFFICIATINGINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS|MEDIA & TELECOMMUNICATIONS|BORIS JOHNSON|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND",

637,This is the moment for us all to make city climate-ready,"November 12, 2021 Friday",Rhode Island,Providence Journal,News,585,NEWS;Pg. A15,585,,ByYour TurnBuff Chace and Michele Jalbert,,SEA LTD,SEA LTD,This is the moment for us all to make city climate-ready,"Providence is at a climate crossroads. While the world made collective progress over the past month in meeting our global climate goals, at the end of the day, just like politics, our climate challenges are local. We have a unique city, with buildings, transportation systems and neighborhoods that will bear the brunt of severe weather wrought by climate change - if we do not act locally to make our city more resilient. And act now.Last week, COP26 brought the world together once again to accelerate a global response. This important meeting of world leaders was followed by Congress and the Biden administration making a $47 billion down-payment on climate resiliency in the infrastructure bill.This is the moment. Providence's institutions and job creators must take the lead to make our city climate-ready. Over the next 30 years, we will experience damaging sea-level rise, river flooding, larger, stronger storms, as well as rising wind and temperatures. Risks that are now urgent will increase over the next two decades to unmanageable levels. That's why the federal infrastructure bill will have a huge impact on climate resiliency, and Providence needs to be ready to compete for these resources. We want to be part of the solution. The Providence Resilience Partnership is a collaboration of private business, not-for-profits and institutional representatives focused on preparing for the impact of climate change and sea level rise in Providence.Last month, the Providence Resilience Partnership highlighted two priority climate resilient infrastructure projects that its member scientists, engineers, planners, philanthropists, academics and job creators believe are ""funding ready."" These priority projects detailed by Alex Kuffner (""Taming the torrent won't be cheap: Climate projects in Providence need federal money,"" News, Sept. 17) are models for community-scale with a major impact. We hope these examples spur greater community planning and advocacy.At the same time, our work has also found many businesses, institutions and governments recognize the need to build and update infrastructure to be climate-ready - but they do not have the resources and expertise to strategically plan, engineer, design, budget and implement these projects at scale. It is a key pain point and missing link between a federal government ready to fund and communities unable to put forward ""funding-ready"" projects. The PRP is making this pain point a priority in the coming months.Recently, a report from PRP and the University of Rhode Island's Coastal Resources Center (URI-CRC)/Rhode Island Sea Grant found a major hurricane would mean nearly $4 billion in damage without adaptation. More than 7,000 Providence small businesses are vulnerable to flooding from storms. And neighborhoods along our rivers already know the impact of worsening flooding, as we experience storms unlike any we've seen in decades.Resiliency actions would protect us from the effects of climate change we are too late to stop and create economic opportunities for our net zero future. We hope our work is the beginning of a long-term process to engage, process, dialogue, plan and execute adaptation projects and actions to make Providence thrive, not just survive.Buff Chace is the founder of Cornish Associates in downtown Providence and the chairman of the Providence Resilience Partnership (PRP). Michele Jalbert is executive director of PRP, formerly with the office of Congressman Bill Delahunt and the New England Council.","Copyright 2021 Providence Publications, LLC All Rights Reserved",,"Newspaper|pfo|ENGLISH|SEA LTD|NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING & BROADCASTING & WEB SEARCH PORTALS|SE (NYSE)|CLIMATE CHANGECLIMATOLOGYUS FEDERAL GOVERNMENTTALKS & MEETINGSWEATHERCIVIL ENGINEERINGGOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATIONFLOODS & FLOODINGHURRICANESNATURAL DISASTERSCHARITIESTECHNICIANS & TECHNOLOGICAL WORKERSCOASTAL AREASMARINE RESOURCES MANAGEMENTRIVERSSEVERE WEATHERNEGATIVE NEWSNONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONSJOB CREATIONSCIENCE FUNDINGSMALL BUSINESSPHILANTHROPY|CIVIL ENGINEERINGTRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTUREMARINE RESOURCES MANAGEMENT|JOE BIDEN|PROVIDENCE, RI, USA|RHODE ISLAND, USA",SE (NYSE)
638,"Time to love business, says Rose, as 'capitalism is the only successful form of economics we know'","November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Daily Telegraph (London),News,700,BUSINESS;Pg. 8,700,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Christopher Hope,,OCADO GROUP PLC,OCADO GROUP PLC,"Time to love business, says Rose, as 'capitalism is the only successful form of economics we know'","Lord Rose of Monewden has had enough. The ex-chief executive of M&S and one time chairman of Ocado thinks it is about time that the Government learnt to love business.Lord Rose - a Conservative life peer since 2014 - says he cannot understand why relations with ministers appear to have deteriorated.""I run two or three large businesses as a chairman and there does seem to be a disconnect between business and politicians and it is something that completely mystifies me,"" he tells the Chopper's Politics podcast.Lord Rose traces the current antipathy back to the Brexit crisis, which has meant that more than five years after the UK voted to leave the European Union, companies are still branded as wanting to stay in.""There is still a feeling that businesses are predominantly 'Remain', businesses are tarred slightly with that label and it's unfortunate because business is actually a lot more pragmatic and forward looking than anybody really understands.""The peer - who chaired the official pro-EU Remain grouping during the divisive referendum campaign - adds: ""Business people want to run a business successfully. They want to run a business profitably and they want to run the business for the good of investors and for themselves. Why would they want to be stuck in a trench that was dug six years ago?""The low point came in 2018 when Boris Johnson, as foreign secretary, reportedly said ""f--- business"" to a group of diplomats when asked about companies' concerns over Brexit.That comment, Lord Rose says, was ""the stupidest thing I ever heard because, very simplistically, we only know one successful form of economics, which is capitalism"".Lord Rose says that the campaigning by the CBI against a no-deal Brexit poisoned relations between the business sector and ministers.He says: ""It did poison the well and there is therefore this sort of hangover feeling or smell that 'business actually isn't on our side'.""I don't think that's the case. You don't need to talk to business people by going through the CBI. You can talk to them individually.""Lord Rose thinks Johnson should restart the business councils, relied on so heavily by his predecessors in No 10, to ensure that companies' concerns are taken seriously.He says: ""I am not suggesting you have a talking shop. I am suggesting you have some sort of mechanism where people can exchange confidentially some of the issues that are around that need to be dealt with, where government and business together can end up with a better result. I just want to see some mutual co-operation. I want to see understanding from both parties about the problems.""Labour was not much better and was too focused on party issues to communicate with business. ""They're so preoccupied with their own internal problems that they just sort of haven't reached out. Now there will be a time when they ought to.""They should be preparing the ground if they want to be a credible opposition and preparing themselves for power at some point in time.""Away from the vexed relationship between business and the Government, Lord Rose says he is more worried about inflation, climate change and migration than Covid-19.He says: ""Covid is finished. That's gone. What's next? Inflation is a serious issue coming our way.""Climate change is a massive issue coming our way. The two are connected. And then you've got one other thing which nobody seems to talk about on a global basis - migration.""Instead of having Cop26, we almost need to have a Mig1. How is the world going to deal with this crisis?""Lord Rose sees a big leap in inflation - pushing up prices for all of us. He adds: ""The Bank of England has woken up to the fact that inflation is going to peak at above 5pc.""I think it'll be for longer rather than shorter. Look at what's happening. America is now 6.2pc. The factory gate inflation in China is now 13pc.""Costs are being passed on at levels of up to 10pc to the high street. Sitting in the Red Lion in Westminster, he adds: ""You cannot run a pub like this just by not putting those costs through.""Chopper's Politics Podcast Listen to Christopher Hope and his guests analyse the week's events.

640,Tories at war in five-hour cabinet showdown: Boris Johnson and his top team thrash out differences late into the night after Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the government 'needs to do better',"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,MailOnline,News,770,NEWS;Version:1,770,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"Jason Groves Political Editor For The Daily MailJames Tapsfield, Political EditorKatie Weston For Mailonline",,,,Tories at war in five-hour cabinet showdown: Boris Johnson and his top team thrash out differences late into the night after Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the government 'needs to do better',"•Rishi Sunak hinted at Cabinet divisions over handling of Owen Paterson scandal•Meanwhile, today's meeting was ostensibly focusing on the Levelling Up agenda•But political discussion is believed to have also addressed cronyism among MPs•The team held crunch talks at Downing Street after dropping Chequers plans                     Boris Johnson and his senior team thrashed out their differences in a five-hour meeting last night after the Chancellor said the government 'needs to do better'.In his first intervention on the crisis, Rishi Sunak hinted at Cabinet divisions over the Prime Minister's disastrous attempt to block the suspension of former minister Owen Paterson for breaking lobbying rules.During a round of media interviews yesterday, Mr Sunak said: 'Reflecting over recent events - I think for us as a Government, it's fair to say that we need to do better than we did last week, and we know that.' Meanwhile, the Cabinet meeting was ostensibly focusing on the Levelling Up agenda with ministers due to lay out how their department is contributing to the drive. Originally the team had planned an away-day at Chequers, but plans for this were dropped and they met at Downing Street instead.Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey arrived armed with an A3 map seemingly to help get her message across.However, the political discussion is believed to have also addressed to how to quell the rising tide of criticism about second jobs, conflicting interests and cronyism among MPs.Health Secretary Sajid Javid, Housing Secretary Michael Gove and Chief Secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke were among those seen departing Downing Street after gathering for crunch talks late into the night.Allies of the Chancellor say he was dismayed by the decision last week to order Tory MPs to vote to tear up Parliament's anti-sleaze laws in order to save Mr Paterson.The Prime Minister won the vote after imposing a three-line whip. Mr Sunak was absent for the vote because he was at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow at the time.But the plan was abandoned the following day in the face of a huge public outcry, prompting Mr Paterson to resign as an MP.The episode has triggered a wave of sleaze allegations against the Conservatives and seen the outside interests of all MPs come under fresh scrutiny.It has also resulted in a Tory slump in the polls, with Labour taking the lead for the first time in a year in several surveys.Mr Sunak did not comment directly on the cases of either Mr Paterson or Sir Geoffrey Cox, the former attorney general who has racked up more than £5.5million in outside earnings.He said: 'People will have different motivations for doing what they do, the pay is set by an independent body, that's absolutely right.'And with regard to second jobs, there's an independent process that we have that's set by Parliament that governs all of those things. And it's absolutely right that that process is followed to the letter.'Cabinet Office minister Steve Barclay expressed 'regret' this week for the 'mistake' made in attempting to force through a change in the rules on the back of Mr Paterson's case.As condemnation grew, the PM moved to remind MPs that they should 'devote yourself primarily and above all to your constituents'. But he proposed no new measures to restore public confidence. And he has so far refused to offer any apology for opening up a damaging line of attack for Labour.An ally of Mr Sunak said he viewed last week's events as 'a mistake' and believed 'that point needs to be made by someone in the Cabinet'.No 10 sources played down suggestions of Cabinet divisions, saying: 'The PM has said that it is vital MPs focus on their constituents and obey the rules. He thinks those who break the rules should be punished. We are all agreed on this.'But another Cabinet source said the PM had 'f***ed up' and that the attempt to block the suspension of Mr Paterson looked 'totally crooked'. Business minister Paul Scully hinted at anger over the damage caused by the sleaze row yesterday.Questioned about the conduct of Sir Geoffrey, he told Sky News: 'I'm not going to defend Geoffrey. I'm not going to say anything.'Backbench Tories also voiced anger at the events of the last week, which have left many of them facing a backlash from constituents.One former minister told the Daily Mail: 'The last week has been a hideous nightmare - it is dirtying us all. When we made him PM we knew there would be periods of chaos but that was a price worth paying to defeat Corbyn and get Brexit done.'Those two tasks are completed now and his situation is more perilous than people think.'

644,Try eliminating coal use; Letters to the editor,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Winnipeg Sun,News,239,COMMENT;Pg. A8,239,Canada,Kelvin DoerksenWinnipeg Sun,,,,Try eliminating coal use; Letters to the editor,"Eliminate or greatly reduce the use of coal. This one action would do more to clean up the planet than anything else, and it is achievable. If COP26 had been for real, that is the one and only pledge they would have made. And they would have done it in a zoom meeting instead of a multi-day star-studded extravaganza. The majority of the people labelled ""climate change deniers"" would agree with this pledge. Ironically, the Apocalyptic Environmentalists in government, media, and groups like Green Peace will not agree, because it's an actual solution. We've all been very wicked, and we must be punished, according to their doctrine. For them, solutions like replacing coal with practical alternatives like natural gas and nuclear energy are not the point. It's all about the suffering. Realistic people understand that solar and wind power will never be the answer. The battery industry, when scaled up to equal the energy volumes of the fossil fuel industry, will be just as harmful to the planet. But I suppose this will suit the AE's, as once again we will have been very, very bad people.KELVIN DOERKSENIf Canada could just get its natural gas to China it would reduce China's reliance on coal-fired electrical generation plants and possibly even prevent the construction of more of those coal plants which would go a long way to reaching GHG emission reduction goals. !@COPYRIGHT=© 2021 Sun Media Corporation.

645,Tuvalu investigating how to stay a country if submerged by rising sea levels,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),News,400,NEWS;Pg. 11,400,England & Wales,STUTI MISHRA,,,,Tuvalu investigating how to stay a country if submerged by rising sea levels,"Pacific island nation Tuvalu is exploring ways to keep its recognition as a state even if it loses all its land to rising sea levels. Simon Kofe, the foreign minister of Tuvalu, said the country was planning for the worst and looking into keeping the ownership of its maritime zones.""We're actually imagining a worst-case scenario where we are forced to relocate or our lands are submerged,"" he told Reuters on Thursday.Pacific island nations are at the forefront of bearing the brunt of the climate crisis as extreme weather events spike and sea levels rise. Many island nations, including Tuvalu and Kiribati, have already lost land to increased water levels. ""We're looking at legal avenues where we can retain our ownership of our maritime zones, retain our recognition as a state under international law. So those are steps that we are taking, looking into the future,"" Mr Kofe said.Earlier this week, in order to emphasise the impact of climate change on the island nation at the Cop26 summit, Mr Kofe delivered a video address standing in knee-deep water on an area of land that had been recently submerged due to rising water levels. Images and videos of Mr Kofe standing in a suit at a lectern set up in the sea with his trousers rolled up have been shared widely on social media.Reacting to the response to the video, Mr Kofe said: ""We didn't think it would go viral as we saw over the last few days. We have been very pleased with that and hopefully that carries the message and emphasises the challenges that we are facing in Tuvalu at the moment,"" he added.Tuvalu is at the risk of becoming one of the first nations to be significantly impacted by rising sea levels due to global climate change. The average height of its islands is less than two metres above sea level and its highest point is about 4.6m above sea level. The nation consists of nine islands in the Pacific region and has a population of some 11,000 people. It has been witnessing an average of 0.5cm rise in sea levels every year for the last 28 years, which is taking up its land area.Tuvalu's leaders earlier also said that vacating the land in case of extreme weather will be their last resort. Mr Kofe also stressed that the older generation of the island nation want to go down with the land. ""The one thing clear is that the people have a very close tie to their land,"" Mr Kofe said.Additional reporting by agencies",Copyright 2021 Independent Print Ltd All Rights Reserved,,Newspaper|IA|ENGLISH|News|CLIMATE CHANGEISLANDS & REEFSINTERNATIONAL RELATIONSINTERNATIONAL LAWINVESTIGATIONSSTATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICESSEVERE WEATHERWEATHERVIRAL VIDEOSNEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS|VIRAL VIDEOS|TUVALUKIRIBATI,

647,Two new draft texts on finance published at c.o.p.,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Hindustan Times Lucknow,News,258,,258,"India, Republic of",,,,,Two new draft texts on finance published at c.o.p.,"Glasgow, Nov. 12 -- Two new draft texts on setting a new collective quantified climate finance goal and long term finance were published on Thursday, which will be of priority to India and other developing countries. There are many bracketed sections and options which are yet to be agreed upon as on Thursday afternoon.The draft on a new quantified goal for post-2025 suggests setting a new collective finance from a floor of $100 billion per year in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency of implementation and taking into account the needs and priorities of developing countries. Alternately, it suggests parties will define an annual mobilisation goal in the form of an ambitious figure, taking into account the needs and priorities of developing countries as expressed in NDCs. On long term finance, there are two sections that could be of importance to developing countries -- coming up with a multilaterally agreed definition on climate finance, and establishing a measurement and tracking platform to be maintained by the secretariat.""The thing to be careful of here is that most of the points are bracketed and are still being debated.

A12,536,, SETH BORENSTEIN and FRANK JORDANS Associated Press ,,ASSOCIATED PRESS,ASSOCIATED PRESS,UN CHIEF: GOAL FOR GLOBAL WARMING IS ON 'LIFE SUPPORT'UNITED NATIONS SUMMIT | CLIMATE CHANGE,"GLASGOW, Scotland - United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday warned that a key temperature goal in climate talks is ""on life support"" but he still hopes that world governments will step up their pledges to slash emissions of greenhouse gases.In an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, Guterres said the negotiations set to end Friday in Glasgow, Scotland, will ""very probably"" not yield the carbon-cutting pledges he has said are needed to keep the planet from warming beyond the 1.5-degree threshold.Still, the U.N. chief wouldn't say at what point he thinks that goal would have to be abandoned.""When you are on the verge of the abyss,"" it's not important to think too far into the future, he said. ""What's important to discuss is what will be your first step. Because if your first step is the wrong step, you will not have the chance to ... make a second or third one.""So far, the talks have not come close to achieving any of the U.N.'s three announced priorities for the annual conference, called COP26. One is cutting carbon emissions by about half by 2030 to reach the goal Guterres alluded to.The other two are getting rich countries to fulfill a 12-year-old pledge of providing $100 billion a year in financial climate aid to poor nations and ensuring that half of that amount goes to helping them adapt to the worst effects of climate change.Guterres said the Glasgow talks ""are in a crucial moment"" and need to accomplish more than securing a weak deal that participating nations agree to support.""The worst thing would be to reach an agreement at all costs by a minimum common denominator that would not respond to the huge challenges we face,"" Guterres said.That's because the overarching goal of limiting warming since pre-industrial times to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century ""is still in reach but on life support,"" Guterres said. The world has already warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius.Less than 36 hours from the scheduled close of the negotiations, Guterres said that if negotiators can't reach ambitious carbon-cutting goals - ""and very probably it will not happen"" - then national leaders would need to come up with new pledges next year and in 2023 during high-level meetings.Guterres later told climate negotiators that ""promises ring hollow when the fossil fuels industry still receives trillions in subsidies ... or when countries are still building coal plants.""In a separate interview late Thursday, former Irish president Mary Robinson accused Saudi Arabia and Russia of trying to cut out or water down language in a draft agreement that would call for a phase-out of coal and an end to fossil fuel subsidies.She also blasted British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the host of the climate talks, for not taking them seriously enough, not being in ""crisis mode"" and sticking around - unlike his French counterpart in 2015.Guterres said he agreed with youth climate activists - who have been a daily presence protesting in large numbers outside the climate talks, and at times inside - who called for the U.N. to term global warming a ""climate emergency"" of a high level.""For me, it is clear it is a climate emergency,"" Guterres said.","Copyright 2021 Madison Newspapers, Inc.

Beijing's envoy, Xie Zhenhua, told the UN summit in Glasgow: ""Both sides recognise that there is a gap between the current effort and the Paris Agreement goals so we will jointly strengthen climate action.""US envoy John Kerry said the two countries were divided on many matters ""but on climate, co-operation is the only way to get this job done"". ""Every step matters right now and we have a long journey ahead of us,"" he said. China and the US account for nearly 40 per cent of all carbon pollution. Mr Xie said the plan would involve ""concrete plans"" for enhanced action this decade and that both the US and China were ready ""to work on the finalisation of the Paris Agreement rulebook"". The 2015 Paris accord commits nations to work towards limiting global temperature rises to between 1.5C and 2C through sweeping emissions cuts. The deal came as a huge surprise, particularly as US President Joe Biden recently slammed his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping for missing the climate summit. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg gave the pledge a cautious welcome.""With respect to China, it is the world's largest emitter and it is important China makes a commitment, a tangible one, to reduce its footprint,"" he said. ""We welcome signs of progress with the US but of course a lot more work needs to be done.""Tensions between China and the West have ratcheted up recently and Mr Xi issued a warning on Thursday. ""Attempts to draw ideological lines or form small circles on geopolitical grounds are bound to fail,"" he said.

This will be an important contribution to more rapid deployment of solar globally. It will be particularly important for developing countries, he said.Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Bhupender Yadav welcomed the US as the 101st member of the ISA.This move will strengthen the ISA and propel future action on providing a clean source of energy to the world, said Yadav.The ISA framework, first circulated for countries to support in 2016, emphasises delivering global relevance and local benefit to all countries through collaborations.The ISA's key interventions focus on readiness and enabling activities, risk mitigation and innovative financing instruments to facilitate the promotion and deployment of solar technologies in target markets.The US' endorsement of ISA's framework and approach is an heartening development, especially as our 101st member nation, which is a significant milestone in itself, demonstrating that nations across the world are recognising the economic and climate mitigating value of solar, as well as this energy source's potential as a catalyst for global energy transition, said Dr Ajay Mathur, Director General of the ISA.We are now even more committed to translating this confidence into tangible projects and developments on the ground, accelerating the momentum of solar adoption that has been builtso far.We hope remaining nations and economies will follow suit, and align with us to achieve swift, affordable and effective climate action, while also achieving their respective economic growth and long-term development priorities, he said.",Copyright 2021 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|SOLAR AS|NAICS423720 PLUMBING & HEATING EQUIPMENT & SUPPLIES (HYDRONICS) MERCHANT WHOLESALERSSIC5074 PLUMBING & HEATING EQUIPMENT & SUPPLIES (HYDRONICS)|SOLAR.B (CPH)|AGREEMENTSEMERGING MARKETSECONOMIC CONDITIONSHEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENTDEVELOPING COUNTRIESGOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERSECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORSENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTSRISK MANAGEMENTECONOMIC GROWTHPRIME MINISTERS|SOLAR ENERGYENERGY & UTILITIESRISK MANAGEMENT|NARENDRA MODI|NEW DELHI, INDIAGLASGOW, SCOTLAND|UNITED STATES",SOLAR.B (CPH)
658,"US 'warns Europe that Russia could invade Ukraine', as troops mass near border","November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Independent (United Kingdom),News,571,"NEWS,WORLD,EUROPE;Version:2",571,England & Wales,Rory Sullivan,,BOEING CO,BOEING COSEA LTD,"US 'warns Europe that Russia could invade Ukraine', as troops mass near border","The US  has reportedly warned its European allies Russia  could attempt to invade more Ukrainian  territory less than a decade after it annexed Crimea. American officials briefed their European colleagues about a potential military assault, amid a large build-up of troops near the Russian-Ukrainian border, according to a Daily Telegraph report.Around 90,000 Russian troops have gathered there, Ukraine's defence ministry said last week. The scenes serve as a reminder of the Russian invasion of Crimea  seven years ago, which resulted in the annexation of the territory. Speaking about the current threat, US secretary of state Antony Blinken  said on Wednesday: ""We don't have clarity into Moscow's intentions, but we do know its playbook. ""And our concern is that Russia may make the serious mistake of attempting to rehash what it undertook back in 2014.""A day later, the Kremlin claimed one of its fighter jets forced a British spy plane to change course after it flew near Crimea on Thursday.The British Boeing RC-135 aircraft reportedly came close to the Black Sea peninsula, which the west still considers to belong to Ukraine.The plane altered its flight path after a Sukhoi SU-30 fighter jet attempted to intercept it, the Russian defence ministry said.The incident comes as the US and its allies increase their military activity in the area in reaction to the gathering of Russian troops near the Ukraine border.Four planes belonging to Nato members were spotted operating near the Black Sea in the space of 24 hours, Russia's defence ministry said on Thursday. This includes the British aircraft that was allegedly made to divert its route.Two Russian warships were also observing two US vessels in the region, Moscow added.Vladimir Putin , the Russian president, described the presence of Western military forces as provocative during a call with the German chancellor Angela Merkel  on Thursday. For its part, the US said it was closely monitoring the situation on the Russian border with Ukraine, and condemned the presence of tens of thousands of Russian troops there.Karen Donfried, the assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia, said on Wednesday: ""Any time we see unusual Russian military activity near Ukraine we make clear that any escalatory or aggressive action is of great concern to the United States.""She added that the US was ""very clear"" in standing with Ukraine against ""Russian aggression"".Russia also flexed its own military muscles on Thursday by sending two nuclear-capable bombers over Belarus, in a show of support for its ally.The move goes against Ms Merkel's demand that Mr Putin exert influence on Belarus, which the EU accuses of weaponising migration on its border with Poland to spite the bloc.Earlier this week, the chancellor's spokesperson said Ms Merkel had told her Russian counterpart that Minsk's actions were ""inhuman and unacceptable"", and amounted to ""state-sanctioned human trafficking"".

The World EXPO 2020 Dubai has become one of the world's event highlights. As one of the most popular destinations for visitors to the event, Vit Nam Pavilion has hosted a variety of exciting cultural activities in the past month. Covering a total area of more than 850sq.m, Vit Nam Pavilion features 800 traditional conical hats with colourful lights that will light up at night and miniatures of 18 pieces created by renowned Vietnamese contemporary artists. It has also impressed visitors with a virtual experience on the country’s most popular tourist attractions and cutting-edge technologies including the world’s first 3D printing carbon fibre object as well as sustainable innovations like the biobased material created from seafood waste and mushrooms. There are even waterproof sneakers made from recycled coffee. “With the theme Distilling the Past, Shaping the Future, Vit Nam values the meaning of ‘connection’ that connects the past and the present, traditional culture and modern technology, in order to create harmony and motivation for future development. ""Vit Nam appreciates exchange and cooperation among cultures and nations. Promoting the application of modern technology to continue the development of traditional culture, harmoniously combining tradition and modernity is one of the core values of Vit Nam Pavilion,” Deputy Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism of Vit Nam, T Quang ông, told Kuwait News. “The Expo helps us to tell the story of our people and country with potential and opportunities for future development. Vit Nam’s participation in the Expo is an act of realising the policy of proactive international integration, while actively contributing to the cause of peace, national independence, democracy and social progress in the world,” he added. Visitors to Vit Nam Pavilion could try playing traditional Vietnamese musical instruments such as lithophone, K'long put or T'rung, watch water-puppet performances, learn about the costumes and customs of Vit Nam’s ethnic minorities through a collection of handmade dolls or enjoy some special dishes of Vietnamese cuisine. The pavilion has received many distinguished guests such as Sierra Leone President Julius Maada Bio, former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Crown Prince of Ajmal (UAE) Sheikh Ammar bin Humaid Bin Rashid, UAE Government Secretary Ahmed Ali Al Sayegh and Secretary General of La Francophonie, Louise Mushikiwabo. Sharing his feelings after visiting the Vit Nam Pavilion in Expo 2020, Dubai, Khaid Bin Amer from India said: “Vit Nam has left a great impression on me. We all feel satisfied when seeing your huge smiles. The art performances here are definitely attractive and showcase your nation’s rich and diversified culture. I will come back to the Vit Nam Pavilion for more.” In addition to daily music and water-puppet shows, Vietnamese artists have also brought to World Expo 2020 unique performances like the collaboration between monochord artist L Giang and traditional Middle Eastern band and male singer Aseel Abu Baker at Jalsat Music Night on October 12.pwa-container-wrapperpwa-container class=""pwa-container "" data-uid=""pwa_E83CC8F20069B9A9B40446F71D60FAE1pwa class=""pwa-mark"" data-pwa-category=""spelling"" data-pwa-heavy=""false"" data-pwa-help-article-id=""1000042"" data-pwa-hint=""Unknown word: L"" data-pwa-id=""pwa-5B1C57A88DBC7479F428011C0A21043A"" data-pwa-rule-id=""SIMPLE_SPELLING"" data-pwa-style-category=""spelling"" data-pwa-suggestions=""le~Li~Le~La~Lu/pwapwa class=""pwa-mark"" data-pwa-category=""spelling"" data-pwa-heavy=""false"" data-pwa-hint=""Incorrect named entity spelling: Abu Baker"" data-pwa-id=""pwa-37E06C0B819049169400C9459222F726"" data-pwa-rule-id=""SSNE_4C20B84A43680E5428CF554477B47896"" data-pwa-style-category=""spelling"" data-pwa-suggestions=""Abu Bakr/pwapwa class=""pwa-mark"" data-pwa-category=""spelling"" data-pwa-heavy=""false"" data-pwa-help-article-id=""1000042"" data-pwa-hint=""Unknown word: Jalsat"" data-pwa-id=""pwa-D854A8CF6C9FA434B486D60EFCB7C1AA"" data-pwa-rule-id=""SIMPLE_SPELLING"" data-pwa-style-category=""spelling"" data-pwa-suggestions=""Jalsan~Jalsai~Jalsa~Jalat~closed/pwapwa/pwa/pwa-container/pwa-container-wrapper For the first time, Vietnamese monochord artist L Giang collaborated with traditional Middle Eastern band and male singer Aseel Abu Baker at Jalsat Music Night on October 12.

Media attention Vit Nam’s first time at Expo 2020 Dubai has attracted attention from the media worldwide. According to statistics from the Department of International Cooperation, Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, over 100 international news sites have published news and photos about the opening ceremony of Vit Nam Pavilion at the event. Kuwait News conducted an exclusive interview with Deputy Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism T Quang ông while Sky News invited Deputy Representative of Vietnam at the Expo Trn Nht Hoàng to attend its morning news programme that is broadcast live to more than 50 million households in the Middle East and North Africa region. Other news agencies from South Africa, UAE and Sweden have also visited Vit Nam’s site at the event to broadcast live. In particular, Vit Nam’s sneakers made from discarded coffee grounds and plastic bottles and circular economy model in coffee production are the highlights in CNN's upcoming report on new sustainable initiatives introduced at this year's Expo. The report is expected to be broadcast on CNN worldwide in December. The most-anticipated event at Vit Nam Pavilion is Vit Nam Day on December 30 with the participation of senior leaders from the country, featuring a variety of activities like a painting exhibition, film week, large-scale fashion-art show as well as a programme to provide information about Vit Nam’s foreign policy, economy, investment, trade and tourism. According to the organisers, Expo 2020 Dubai welcomed more than 2.35 million visitors, 17 per cent of which were international visitors from 185 different countries, in the first month. For the first time in its history, 192 participating countries all have their own exhibition halls. It is estimated that over 1,980 government leaders including ministers, presidents, prime ministers and heads of state have been present at the Expo to attend the opening ceremony, deliver speeches or attend their national days. More than 5,610 official events have been organised so far, many of which closely follow global challenges and hot issues such as Climate and Biodiversity Week that took place prior to the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) or Space Week exploring potential space exploitations. Expo 2020 Dubai will run until March 31, 2022. VNS",Copyright 2021 Viet Nam News All Rights Reserved,,Newspaper|English US|EXPO 2020|VIET NAM,
660,Visitor numbers eclipse cathedral's former levels,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,"The Journal (Newcastle, UK)",News,636,NEWS;Pg. 3,636,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,NICOLE GOODWIN,,,,Visitor numbers eclipse cathedral's former levels,"VISITOR figures at Durham Cathedral have soared past pre-­Covid levels in recent months following the success of Mu­ seum of the Moon.Durham Cathedral's nave has played host to Luke Jerram's widely­ celebrated artwork since September 13.And as the installation drew to a close yesterday, the cathedral is cele­ brating its highest visitor number in recent years, with over 90,500 people visiting the cathedral while the Moon has been in situ.Over 9,000 of those people have travelled to the cathedral for one of the unique events centred around the installation, including yoga, silent discos, organ recitals and star­ gazing. Andrew Usher, Chief Assistant Officer of Visitor Experience and Enterprise at Durham Cathedral, said: ""We're delighted to have hosted Museum of the Moon and to wel­ come so many people to the cathe­ dral. ""We've seen lots of people return­ ing to the cathedral again since the pandemic as well as many people visiting the cathedral for the very first time, both during the day and on the evening for the unique events programme.""During the lockdowns of last year, the cathedral carried out extensive research into the demographics of County Durham and part of our re­ opening has been to engage actively with the diverse audiences across the county in a variety of ways.""These astronomical figures show an increase of more than 20,000 visi­ tors in the same period in 2019.Durham Cathedral receives no statutory funding and relies on the support of those who visit for prayer, worship, events or heritage to con­ tinue its mission and ministry.The increased visitor figures has also seen an increase in donations to the cathedral which will help its financial recovery following the pan­ demic. The Very Reverend Andrew Trem­ lett, Dean of Durham, said: ""We have a long-­standing policy of not charg­ ing for entry, but rather encouraging the generosity of those who come through the doors.""Whatever someone's motivation for coming to the cathedral over the last nine weeks, the Moon has undoubtedly been part of their expe­ rience. ""It has been part of the life of our living, working cathedral - at the centre of special events, a presence during services, both in the cathe­ dral and online, and has also given a focal point for reflecting on current events.""For example, this week visitors have been invited to pray for COP26 meeting in Glasgow, with the Muse­ um of the Moon reminding us of our part in the universe.""Luke Jerram's Museum of the Moon has also proved hugely attrac­ tive to young families, with over 15,000 people of all ages visiting dur­ ing half-­term week alone.The Dean added: ""The sense of awe and wonder the monumental scale of Museum of the Moon instils was visible during the hourly prayers, led by the daily chaplain, who reported children sitting under the moon or in the front pews, join­ ing in the recitation of the Lord's Prayer - in fact, leading their parents to do so.""Since its opening day, visitors have been stopped in their tracks to take in the Moon installation, with many describing it as 'spectacular' and 'awe-­inspiring', whilst others defined it as 'grounding', 'spiritual' and 'reflective'.The inflated Moon installation is a fusion of detailed NASA imagery of the lunar surface, moonlight, and surround sound composition.To find out more about events and services at the cathedral visit www.durhamcathedral.co.uk Durham Cathedral is a member of Culture Durham, the partnership spearheading County Durham's bid to be UK City of Culture 2025.Museum of the Moon is a shining example of how the county seizes opportunities to create unforgettable experiences for its communities, using the latest technology to allow people to engage with culture and the arts in a truly immersive way.We're delighted to have hosted Museum of the Moon Andrew Usher",Copyright 2021 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|TJN|ENGLISH|National Edition|TRAVEL & HOSPITALITY SECTOR PERFORMANCEASTRONOMY & SPACECOVID CORONAVIRUSTRENDS & EVENTSCLERGY & RELIGIOUS VOCATIONS|MUSEUMS & GALLERIESTRAVEL & HOSPITALITY SECTOR PERFORMANCE|NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE, ENGLANDGLASGOW, SCOTLAND|ENGLAND",
661,Vitriolic culture around football needs to change,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Western Daily Press,News,1094,SPORT;Pg. 39,1094,England & Wales,KEITH WATSON,,,,Vitriolic culture around football needs to change,"IMAGINE the scene. It is a dark Saturday evening, and a man in his 40s walks alone down a quiet road. From the other direction, a group of about ten lads half his age approach. None of the group know the man, but upon reaching each other, death threats are made towards him and verbal abuse about his wife and children is shouted.Fortunately for me, that never happened. I am the man in his 40s, and I was walking along a quiet road after dark last weekend. A group of lads did appear from the other direction, but they stepped into the road as we passed and we all continued on our way, because that is what happens in normal life.Just an hour earlier, and less than a mile away, however, a different group of similarly-aged young men thought that it was appropriate to verbally abuse someone about their private life despite the presence of hundreds of witnesses. Presumably they thought it was okay because they were in a football ground.The carnival atmosphere had long since fallen flat at Lodge Road last Saturday as Yate trailed National League Yeovil 4-0 early in the second half, but it still felt like an occasion that the Southern League club could be proud of. For some of us stood at the eastern end of the ground, however, that feeling diminished the longer the game went on, and it had little to do with what was happening on the pitch.To the right of the goal, a group of loud-mouthed yobs began to shout about the private life of Yeovil goalkeeper Grant Smith. This unedifying spectacle continued for virtually the whole of the second half, with the name of his daughter and her mother being moronically chanted.A day later, Oxford striker Matty Taylor endured similar treatment from some of the Bristol Rovers fans who used to idolise him. ""We're going to have a party when Matty Taylor's dead"" chanted a portion of the travelling Gasheads at the Kassam Stadium. His crime? Joining Rovers' hated rivals Bristol City in 2017, a step up to Championship football for the striker. Many football supporters like to view themselves as a hard-asnails bunch, but they become very emotionally-delicate flowers when someone opts to reject their club.Players and managers can be guilty of overstepping the line too though. Take Bristol Manor Farm boss Lee Lashenko, who was caught on camera being held back by his own players and aggressively ranting at referee Richard Lawrence after an FA Trophy defeat to Paulton last month.When Lashenko, pictured, later attempted to explain the chain of events that led to the incident, he said at one point: ""I'm no Snow White, like most people in football.""Does that mean some supporters, managers, coaches and players believe it is okay to display such outrageous behaviour simply because, supposedly, everybody else does? Is the whole culture of football geared towards allowing this kind of hatred and aggression to be dressed up as passion and commitment?Standing at Lodge Road, I felt very sorry for Grant Smith. As a goalkeeper myself, I know that it only takes one person behind the goal to start talking rubbish to annoy you and, unlike all the outfield players, goalkeepers do not generally get to run to another part of the pitch to temporarily escape the oafish comments of a particular individual or group.Indeed initially, I wondered whether the idiots at Yate even had the right Smith, as they kept shouting 'Adam', as in the ex-Bristol Rovers, Forest Green and Yeovil stopper now at Stevenage, rather than 'Grant', before one of their number eventually realised their mistake.Yet while the abuse shouted at Smith was very clearly out of order, I subsequently found it harder to feel sorry for someone who celebrated the penalty shootout victory over Weymouth in the previous round by repeatedly thrusting his groin right behind the opposition player who had just ballooned his spot-kick over the crossbar, before later replying to a tweeted video of the incident with crying-laughing emojis.Away from football, the world has changed or is changing. The #MeToo movement is rightly highlighting past incidents of sexual abuse and sexual harassment, and showing that such predatory behaviour is not acceptable. The phone-hacking scandal has shown that national newspapers and large media groups must operate with decency and credibility rather than immorality, while COP26 demonstrates that the human race cannot continue to burn fossil fuels, destroy rainforests and generally trash the environment. Things must change.Football, of course, is built upon passion and commitment, but it does not have to spill over into personal abuse or indecency. Although it happens less now the crowds are back, it always amuses me when a commentator apologises if any ""inappropriate language"" is picked up by one of the pitchside microphones. Apologise for the ""bad language"" by all means, but I cannot think of many more appropriate places for a few f-bombs to be dropped in the heat of the moment.Perhaps social media is to blame for all this, although the problem is clearly some of the people who use it rather the platforms themselves, who nevertheless still have work to do. But when it is easy to fling insults, abuse and threats with anonymity and from behind a screen and, let's face it, football talk is a massive chunk of social media in the UK, some people are emboldened by this and use the anonymity of a crowd to produce similarly vitriolic words and behaviour at matches.Like Matty Taylor said on Sunday, there is a line, and some of the Bristol Rovers supporters crossed it. Taylor is entitled to cup his ear to the crowd when he scores, and the fans are entitled to tell him to f*** off when he does, but they are not entitled to glorify his would-be death.Grant Smith should not simulate sex on the football field, or anywhere else really, but he nor any other player should have to feel threatened by hearing the names of his close family chanted in a sinister fashion.And while Lee Lashenko may not be Snow White, he needs to make sure he does not come across as her friend Dopey either. In the aftermath of his outburst, he revealed that his 15-year-old son had received abusive text messages on the subject, showing the damaging knock-on effect these incidents can have.Everyone is in control of what they say and do at football matches. Even in the heat of the moment, people know the difference between a sweary outburst and more physical or personal abuse and death threats. Many aspects of our world are changing, and changing for the better. There is no reason why football should not do so too.",Copyright 2021 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|WDP|ENGLISH|National Edition|ABUSE & NEGLECTNEGATIVE NEWSNEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWSSPORTS FANSSTADIUMS & ARENASMANAGERS & SUPERVISORSATHLETESCOACHES & TRAINERSSPORTS & RECREATION EVENTSSPORTS OFFICIATINGPSYCHOLOGICAL ABUSESOCCER TOURNAMENTSCRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT & CORRECTIONS|OXFORD, ENGLAND",

Following Government guidelines check in time is earlier due to registration for both Albert Halls and The Arts Society. Masks should be worn in the hall. The lecture is entitled 'Indian Buffalo and Storms: The American West in 19th Century Art' by Tony Faber. Artists were never far behind the explorers who opened up the west of America in the 19th century. Sometimes they painted what they saw. Sometimes they painted what they wished they saw. Either way, painters like Alfred Miller, Frederick Church and Albert Bierstadt have left a powerful, if romanticised, record of the country and people that the settlers found. Now we can use their pictures to chart thehistory of the opening of America's West - the arrival of the railroad, the confinement of Native Americans into reservations and the extermination of the buffalo.

Regular weekly meetings have offered the opportunity for anyone interested to share in prayers and readings on subjects such as ""One Humanity"", ""The Heart"", ""Imprisonment and Freedom"", and ""Love"". Also, monthly 'Fireside' discussion evenings offer such subjects as ""Justice"" and ""Unity""; on November 26 the subject will be ""Reflections on Baha'u'llah's letter to Queen Victoria and Members of Parliament"", which was written from his prison in what was then Palestine. In addition, a session on COP26 is planned to follow the gathering in Glasgow in November, details to come shortly. STIRLING RECORDED MUSIC At the last meeting a different kind of music to the usual classical music was presented by Fred Trott who had spent several years in Africa and took a great interest in the traditional music of many African countries including South Africa,Tanzania and Mali. Predominantly, the programme consisted of drumming, choral and solo singing with strong foottapping rhythms. It was interesting to know that one of the groups, Amadou and Mariam, who are both blind, had performed in the Edinburgh Festival. This talk was accompanied by fascinating anecdotes and experiences of African musicians.OCHILS MOUNTAINEERING CLUB Despite unsettled weather last weekend some club members managed hillwalking in Glen Lochay near Killin.

664,We can all be heroes - but we must act now,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Manchester Evening News,News,452,NEWS;Pg. 25,452,England & Wales,ALAN WRIGHT,,,,We can all be heroes - but we must act now,"WHEN I was a lad the only people that could save the planet were Doctor Who and Rocket Robin Hood.At COP26 in Glasgow, we are now relying on governments and oil companies to don their capes and use their super powers to stop the Earth warming to deadly levels.And they turned up from all over the world, pumping out carbon from their private jets, to tell us not to worry.What we really needed was action, but our leaders are more than happy to pass those actions onto us.To be honest, they have a point, because we need to lower our carbon output, cut down on travel, be more sensible in what we eat and recycle everything we possibly can.As a Wildlife Trust, we are keen to stress that while some people believe we are starting to see the effects of climate change now, wildlife has been feeling its effects for the past 100 years.If we ever need to prove that humanity is having a devastating effect on Planet Earth, just investigate the numbers of species that are now extinct or those that are on a road from where there is no recovery. The biodiversity crisis is not just killing individual birds, mammals, insect and plants, it is actually wiping out our species.In the North West we have lost two types of bumblebee and many species have become locally extinct.For instance, you won't see two turtle doves at Christmas in Manchester, or at any other time of year.We cling onto good news, hearing that the nightjar has returned to the Manchester peatlands in the past three years and we are reintroducing rare butterflies onto those mosses, but overall the picture is not good.While the government is requesting that we do more (if one in four or us took action it would help to reverse the climate crisis) the best way to make people take action is to force their hands.There should be fines for people not recycling properly and heavier fines for people littering. These are not Draconian measures, these are basic, easy things that every one of us can remember.Littering is about being polite and respecting our neighbours and our communities.If waste is disposed of properly fewer animals will become ensnared in plastic packaging or swallow horrible rubbish in the sea. A couple of years ago, there was a picture of a swan which had made a nest out of plastic on the Ship Canal.This wasn't cute, it was heartbreaking to see. It could not find any natural nesting materials amongst the waste.And do you have to drive to the shops and school? Walking is good for you and the environment, when possible.Once we are doing our bit we can then add our voices to demand more action from our leaders. It's time for us all to change the world, to make sure there is a world to change.We can all be superheroes.",Copyright 2021 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|MEN|ENGLISH|National Edition|WILDLIFECLIMATE CHANGEANIMALSINSECTS & ARACHNIDSLITTERINGNEGATIVE MISC NEWSNEGATIVE NEWSBIODIVERSITYBIRDSENVIRONMENTAL & WILDLIFE ORGANIZATIONSMAMMALSWILDLIFE CONSERVATIONNEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSANIMAL WELFAREPRODUCT PACKAGING|OIL & GAS INDUSTRYPRODUCT PACKAGING|MANCHESTER, ENGLANDGLASGOW, SCOTLAND|EARTH",
665,We cannot have climate justice without social justice,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Namibian Sun,News,566,,566,"Namibia, Republic of",,,,,We cannot have climate justice without social justice,"We cannot have climate justice without social justice Rachel ShiwedaIsraeli's energy and water resources minister, Karine Elharrar, who uses a wheelchair, was denied access to the United Nations COP26 climate summit on Monday, 1 November. This was because the conference venue was inaccessible to persons using wheelchairs. The only options to reach the conference venue were to either walk for almost a kilometre or to board shuttle buses which were not wheelchair accessible. After two hours of waiting outside because the organisers refused her entry to the conference grounds in the vehicle she arrived in, she was eventually forced to return to her hotel, which was 80 km away. How could the organisers allow this to happen and why were they so uncooperative? How did the organisers overlook such an important aspect at its event? This experience must have been very disappointing, frustrating but not unfamiliar to Elharrar, who simply wanted to meet with her counterparts and discuss the climate crisis. The foreign affairs minister of Israel, Yair Lapid, weighed in with the following statement: ""It is impossible to take care of the future, the climate, and sustainability if we don't first take care of people, accessibility, and people with disabilities.""Eventually a plan was put into motion which ensured that Elharrar could participate in the summit from 2 November onwards. This incident is one of many examples which demonstrate the importance of physical access to buildings and public facilities. Persons with disabilities are excluded from participation. It also includes any other place a person might need to go for work, play, education, training, business and service. Physical access is important because it allows for equal, and equitable, access for people with disabilities. About five percent of Namibians, approximately 100 000 people have some form of disability. Those disabilities may impact their ability to walk, climb stairs, hear, see, or grasp objects. For that reason, new buildings need to have accessibility features in place. Common accessibility features include, but are not limited to ramps and lifts. Buildings should be evenly lit, not too bright or too dark, especially for persons with visual impairment. Signs must be in Braille and in large print to let people with visual impairments know where they need to go. Reception counters and light switches should not be too high to accommodate persons using wheelchairs and people of short stature. With regard to wheelchairs, doors should be wide enough, not too heavy, and easily opened and closed; wide enough corridors; accessible toilets and parking bays. With the assistance of the National Disability Council of Namibia (NDCN), Namibia is in the process of developing a disability accessibility standard for all public buildings and infrastructure. The draft standard is currently with the Namibia Standards Institute. Once the standard is finalised, all new public buildings will be required by law to be accessible to people with various types of disabilities and older public buildings will receive a grace period to make them accessible. While accessibility is very important, it is not the only thing that needs to be changed. It is the negative attitudes, perceptions, and prejudices of people towards people with disabilities that needs to change the most. Technical Advisor, GIZ Namibia ",Copyright 2021 NHM.

666,"We HAVE to do better on sleaze, Rishi wa rns Boris;MPs' SLEAZE SCANDAL","November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Scottish Daily Mail,News,584,"NEWS;Pg. 12,13",584,"Scotland
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland",Jason Groves,,,,"We HAVE to do better on sleaze, Rishi wa rns BorisMPs' SLEAZE SCANDAL","RISHI Sunak took a swipe at Boris Johnson's handling of the sleaze scandal yesterday, saying the Government needed to 'do better' on the toxic issue.In his first intervention on the crisis, the Chancellor hinted at Cabinet divisions over the Prime Minister's disastrous attempt to block the suspension of former minister Owen Paterson for breaking lobbying rules.During a round of media interviews yesterday, Mr Sunak said: 'Reflecting over recent events - I think for us as a Government, it's fair to say that we need to do better than we did last week, and we know that.'Allies of the Chancellor say he was dismayed by the decision last week to order Tory MPs to vote to tear up Parliament's anti-sleaze laws in order to save Mr Paterson.The Prime Minister won the vote after imposing a three-line whip. Mr Sunak was absent for the vote because he was at the Cop26 summit in Glasgow at the time.But the plan was abandoned the following day in the face of a huge public outcry, prompting Mr Paterson to resign as an MP.The episode has triggered a wave of sleaze allegations against the Conservatives and seen the outside interests of all MPs come under fresh scrutiny.It has also resulted in a Tory slump in the polls, with Labour taking the lead for the first time in a year in several surveys.Mr Sunak did not comment directly on the cases of either Mr Paterson or Sir GeoffreyCox, the former attorney general who has racked up more than £5.5million in outside earnings.He said: 'People will have different motivations for doing what they do, the pay is set by an independent body, that's absolutely right.'And with regard to second jobs, there's an independent process that we have that's set by Parliament that governs all of those things. And it's absolutely right that that process is followed to the letter.'Cabinet Office minister Steve Barclay expressed 'regret' this week for the 'mistake' made in attempting to force through a change in the rules on the back of Mr Paterson's case.As condemnation grew, the PM moved to remind MPs that they should 'devote yourself primarily and above all to your constituents'.But he proposed no new measures to restore public confidence. And he has so far refused to offer any apology for opening up a damaging line of attack for Labour.An ally of Mr Sunak said he viewed last week's events as 'a mistake' and believed 'that point needs to be made by someone in the Cabinet'.No 10 sources played down suggestions of Cabinet divisions, saying: 'The PM has said that it is vital MPs focus on their constituents and obey the rules. He thinks those who break the rules should be punished. We are all agreed on this.'But another Cabinet source said the PM had 'f***ed up' and that the attempt to block the suspension of Mr Paterson looked 'totally crooked'. Business minister Paul Scully hinted at anger over the damage caused by the sleaze row yesterday.Questioned about the conduct of Sir Geoffrey, he told Sky News: 'I'm not going to defend Geoffrey. I'm not going to say anything.'Backbench Tories also voiced anger at the events of the last week, which have left many of them facing a backlash from constituents.One former minister told the Daily Mail: 'The last week has been a hideous nightmare - it is dirtying us all. When we made him PM we knew there would be periods of chaos but that was a price worth paying to defeat Corbyn and get Brexit done.'Those two tasks are completed now and his situation is more perilous than people think.'Comment - Page 20",Copyright 2021 Associated Newpapers Ltd.

668,WE WILL NEVER FORGET THEM;REMEMBRANCE DAY 2021,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Express,News,838,"NEWS;Pg. 2,3",838,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Cyril Dixon,,,,WE WILL NEVER FORGET THEMREMEMBRANCE DAY 2021,"THE Duchess of Cornwall led Britain in silent tribute yesterday as the nation kept its promise to never forget its fallen war heroes.As Camilla represented the Queen at a poignant Westminster Abbey service, towns, cities and villages came to a standstill for two minutes at the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month.This year's Remembrance Day was especially important because Covid restrictions prevented most people from paying their respects in 2020.So yesterday's scenes - when hundreds of thousands stopped to pay tribute to the heroes who died for our country - were in stark contrast to the deserted monuments at the height of the pandemic.The Queen, who has been advised to stick to desk duties after her recent health scare, marked the occasion by authorising aides to post a 2004 Remembrance Day photograph of her on Instagram.Her daughter-in-law, Sophie Countess of Wessex, attended an Armistice Service in Bedworth, Warwicks, and laid a wreath at the town's war memorial.And the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester were at a packed service at the National Memorial Arboretum, in Alrewas, Staffs. At the Westminster Abbey service - attended by hundreds of veterans, senior clergy and military top brass - Camilla wore the green of the Rifles. She became a colonel of the regiment after the late Prince Philip passed the honour onto her.The Duchess laid a symbolic floral tribute at the grave of the unknown warrior. Her bouquet included red garden roses for love and devotion, thyme for strength and courage, bay for merit, lavender for protection and rose hips as a symbol of farewell.Last year, she visited the 752-year-old abbey flanked by just a handful of guides.This year, as the UK recovers from Covid, she was in bustling company as she placed a small wooden crucifix on top of a large poppy-covered cross at the abbey's Field of Remembrance.Other dignitaries in-cluded Rear Admiral Lionel Jarvis, president of the Poppy Factory, which has been organising the Field of Remembrance since November 1928.What began as just a handful of poppies, grew into the moving modern spectacle, with tens of thousands planted on tributes there every year.Camilla also spent time viewing regimental memorial plots and meeting representatives of the Armed Forces. The Duchess's presence was warmly welcomed by the veterans who had turned out in force.Chelsea pensioner Major Hugo White, 91, said: ""It is very important to have the Duchess here today as she is a member of the Royal Family who we look up to.""Greg Hedges, 56, of the Staffordshire Regiment Association, chatted to Camilla as she stroked his Staffordshire bull terrier mascot, Corporal Watchman VI. The formerWarrant Officer 2nd Class revealed: ""They've met before.""He added: ""It's important to have that representation and to remember those who have died.""Arthur Barty, who was the Queen Mother's driver for 27 years, was representing his former unit - the Black Watch - agreed. He said: ""It's vital we keep this tradition alive of commemorating the fallen.""Peter Fullelove, 88, another Chelsea pensioner and Black Watch veteran, joked: ""I asked if she stopped because she liked the colour of my coat. She said she did.""Camilla also met Alice Wingate Pearce, grand-daughter of Major General Orde Wingate, who founded of the famous Chindits jungle warfare troops.Alice said afterwards: ""It's a great honour to be here, I haven't done this before.""I explained my grandfather's medals to the Duchess and she said, 'Wonderful'.""As more wreaths were laid at the Cenotaph in London, politicians paid their respects. Prime Minister Boris Johnson observed the silence at 10 Downing Street and Labour leader Keir Starmer laid a wreath at London's Euston Station.In Glasgow, Scotland's First MinisterNicola Sturgeon joined COP26 President Alok Sharma to lead delegates paying tribute at the climate change summit.As Big Ben began to chime, crowds fell silent at railway stations. A Merseyside fire crew stood alongside a giant poppy made of hoses. And in Burton-on-Trent, England football manager Gareth Southgate and his players paused training to pay their respects.They remembered them too on the other side of world. Poppies were projected onto the famous opera house in Sydney,Australia.Thousands also observed the silence in Cardiff, Edinburgh, Belfast and Dublin.In Belfast, First Minister Paul Givan laid a wreath at the City Hall garden of remembrance. In Edinburgh, veterans and government officials gathered at the garden of remembrance, while the silence was ended by a single gun salute from the castle.For one little girl in the city, a one-year-old called Grace Pettie, yesterday was her first Remembrance Day. But the nation has vowed the tradition will carry on for ever.Jim Wilson, general secretary of Veteran Scotland, said: ""It's really important to have the opportunity to remember.""It does make a difference for people, to step back and think about the sacrifices that people have made during the Great War, WorldWarTwo and all the conflicts beyond.""",Copyright 2021 Express Newspapers All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|DXP|ENGLISH|National Edition|BRITISH ROYALTYRELIGIOUS FACILITIESBRITISH NOBILITY & GENTRYCOVID CORONAVIRUSCOVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICYNATIONAL PARKSRETIREMENT & RETIREESCEASEFIRESROYALTY, NOBILITY & GENTRYARMED FORCESDEATH & DYINGTALKS & MEETINGSRELIGIONASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS|BRITISH ROYALTYBRITISH NOBILITY & GENTRYNATIONAL PARKSROYALTY, NOBILITY & GENTRYARMED FORCES|CAMILLA, DUCHESS OF CORNWALLPRINCE PHILIP|WESTMINSTER, ENGLAND|UNITED KINGDOM",

670,"What I would have told the Army, if I had the chance","November 12, 2021",International,i - Independent Print Ltd,News,670,NEWS;Pg. 27,670,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Chris Taylor,,,,"What I would have told the Army, if I had the chance","Why did the Army withdraw its invitation to me, as a representative of Extinction Rebellion, to speak at its leadership conference next month? Was it political pressure? Nerves within senior leadership? A subconscious unwillingness to stare into the difficult truths of the climate and ecological emergency? I suspect I'll never know. But I do feel robbed of a chance to sit with people I don't normally meet to explore the issue of our age.What was I planning to say? I would have started by painting a picture - sketched out by both climate scientists and military strategists - of global heating as a major threat to peace and global stability. It's not a pretty picture, so I can understand why senior officers may not want to scare the troops. But it's important that we all face into this. As COP26 replays the tired script of empty promises and kicking difficult issues into the long grass, we are looking at the very real possibility of runaway climate change.The picture is of a 4°C warming world where the entire tropical zone becomes uninhabitable and 800 million people begin to move towards more temperate zones. Future scenarios describe a world where crops fail, drought spreads and tropical storms intensify. Where sea levels rise, the Himalayan glaciers that provide water to billions melt away - and there is a very real prospect of starvation, disease and conflict on a scale we have never before seen.The military would face a hard choice. It may be asked to close borders, to crush dissent, to impose martial law for fear of social breakdown. But I wanted to tell my audience that, according to RebeccaSolnit in her book A Paradise Built in Hell, this is the wrong thing to do.Having looked at numerous natural disasters across the world, Solnit writes about how it is almost always the ordinary people who save the situation. They self-organise to protect the most vulnerable and to make sure resources are evenly distributed. When authorities, particularly the military or armed police, step in with force it causes violence and disrupts relief efforts. She calls this ""elite panic"", a mindset based on fear and mistrust.I want the military to consider that they can trust the people, encourage them to start learning now how to support spontaneous self-organisation and to plan ahead for peaceful action in the face of social collapse.Did I think my words would have any real impact? I have no way of knowing. My plan was simply to plant a few seeds and see if any of them grew. Maybe this article can do that instead.There's one more thing I wanted to say. It's about archetypes - characters or impulses that recur throughout history and across cultures. Archetypes are the basis for human stories, especially those with hidden meaning or life lessons. I have found that they have an ability to reach into someone's psyche in a way that facts and figures, opinions and beliefs sometimes fail to.So I was planning to talk about the ""warrior"" archetype. My words would have been something like this: It seems to me that people who join the military are answering the call of the warrior within them. As a lifelong pacifist, I wish to honour and respect this call. It is a noble call, and one that is essential in all societies.The true calling of the warrior is to preserve peace, to protect the vulnerable, both human and environmental. It is in essence to uphold the balance of nature. But this is being abused, distorted by an economy that is systematically destroying the world in pursuit of endless economic growth. The noble call of the warrior is being exploited for nefarious ends, being used to wage war and conquest instead of to protect what is sacred.This is the deeper task the military will face as the climate and ecological emergency unfolds. The mission is to reclaim the rightful role of the warrior within society.

Neil McIntyre, whose book Chasing the Deer, follows the red deer through the seasons, has criticised the removal of a close season for males, which would mean that they be shot at any time, and reducing the length of the female close season. \xE2That\xE2s reducing them to an even lower status than they are now,\xE2 he said. \xE2And the impact of that would be, I think, quite catastrophic\xE2In an interview in the Herald\xE2s Saturday magazine, he explained his concerns over the fact that deer were now being seen as little more than \xE2a pest\xE2. One of his reasons for writing the book, he said, was\xC2 \xE2to try to get some respect back for them, because sadly over the last literally two decades their stature so to speak has been much maligned, reduced to nothing more than a pest in some people\xE2s mind.\xE2\xC2In recent decades, the deer has become a target in the firing line of the fight against climate change and biodiversity loss. Its numbers, various reports have said, must be controlled because of the ways in which deer browse on young trees and prevent reforestation. It's an issue that seems all the more potent in the wake of COP26, as we strive to hit national targets.In 2020 a report was published by the Scottish Government\xE2s independent Deer Working Group, which delivered a range of recommendations including phasing out the use of lead ammunition to cull deer, modernisation of existing deer legislation, the development of robust deer management plans and enhanced monitoring of deer numbers.\xC2Earlier this year, when Ben Macpherson, then Minister for Rural Affairs and the Natural Environment, announced the policy proposals, he noted, \xE2As the scale of tackling climate change and the biodiversity crisis increases, and the measures needed to address these challenges become ever more necessary, it is evident that a significant stepping-up of deer management efforts are required.\xE2McIntyre, who is from a deer stalking family,\xC2is also critical of the zero tolerance approach to deer adopted by some estates. \xE2There are several rewilding estates\xC2 that have followed that strategy. It suits their agenda. They want full scale natural regeneration, and there\xE2s no getting away from it, there has been over-grazing. They've adopted this policy\xC2and ultimately that\xE2s how they\xE2ve managed to get such prolific regeneration. It\xE2s an ongoing process, and it\xE2s not management. They dress it up, they\xE2re very careful with their words. They\xE2ll say things like we\xE2re increasing deer cull numbers or we\xE2ll increase the management, but what they actually mean is it\xE2s zero tolerance.\xE2",Copyright 2021 NewsQuest Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved,,Newspaper|ENGLISH|WILDLIFEANIMALSMAMMALSBIODIVERSITYINTERVIEWSPUBLIC POLICYSPORT HUNTINGNEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWSREFORESTATIONLEGISLATION|MAGAZINE PUBLISHINGMEDIA & TELECOMMUNICATIONSREFORESTATION,

She has UK responsibility for the French car maker's parent company Stellantis and is a senior vice-president for the international group.STARTING OUTI met Linda Jackson and Julie David at the new Stellantis flagship Robins and Day dealership in Chiswick, West London.During her time heading Citroen and before, Mrs Jackson would regularly carry out mystery shopping' trips to her own and rival dealerships. Her face is too well known to continue that today, but as the boss she's in a position to drive change.After starting with a holiday job as a clerk at Jaguar, Mrs Jackson moved to Rover, gaining an MBA at Warwick University, and rising through the ranks to become European finance director before joining Citroen in 2005.She was managing director for Citroen UK and Ireland from 2010 to 2014 when she became chief executive of Citroen the first English woman to run a major car company. Her new brief includes taking Peugeot even more upmarket, expanding sales globally including into South America, the Middle East, Africa, and China and accelerating the move towards electrification.By the end of this year, 70 per cent of our models will have an electrified version - whether hybrid or fully electric. By 2025 we'll be 100 per cent electrified,' she said. And by 2030 all or models will have a fully electric version.But as the Cop26 eco-extravaganza comes to an end, the failure of governments at home and abroad to match their ambitious electric car targets with a sufficiently robust public charging network is a real concern.'Peugeot sells more than a million cars a year globally, and is on track for 100,000 this year in the UK with the 208 supermini the biggest seller. Among the latest models is the new 308 hybrid hatchback in a fetching olivine green launch colour.In 2017, Mrs Jackson was named the most influential Briton in the global car industry', topping a poll of 50 car executives in the annual Auto Express Brit List' the first time a female executive has taken top spot.A year later she won Autocar's Great British Women in the Car Industry award, a feat emulated by her colleague Alison Jones.THE FULL PICTUREAS leading executives, they are not there to create cars specifically for women, but to consider the full range of issues.That includes design, interior storage and luggage space, ambience, practicality, and personal safety and how people are treated in the showroom whether buying there or online. Mrs Jackson said: We need to make showrooms a warm and welcoming place with a good ambience.People will do a lot online. But they still want to see the colour of the paint and sense the touch and feel of the car.'Telling me of her undercover visits, she said: You do learn a lot about how the customer is treated. Sometimes you go into a showroom with your husband and they just turn to your male partner and say, How would you like to spend your money?''We want to make it easier for anyone to buy a car.'How is it to have women in three of the top jobs? I never think of it like that,' she said. It's not about gender. It's about whether you are credible and capable.'Peugeot's UK managing director, Julie David, said she also undertook mystery shopping' before switching from Jaguar Land Rover.Rolling up outside one showroom in a sports car and parking it prominently, she was astonished by the complete lack of interest from staff in the dealership. No one spoke to me,' she said. I love driving. Women do love driving and performance.'Stellantis boss Alison Jones believes mentorship and coaching are important, and advises those with ambitions to rise through the industry to find a mentor with career experience of an area they find really interesting and want to emulate.ON THE HORIZONBEYOND Peugeot, industry rising star Moyosola Fujamade, who works as contract hire relationships manager for Kia in the UK, recently published a report on diversity in the motor industry, speaking to many of the industry's senior executives.She said: I was once told that persistence and patience would be the two things that would see me through my career. And while I must agree in part, I do also believe in knocking down doors every now and again.Breaking down barriers for me has been about not being afraid to speak out. Also, having a mentor has been a fantastic developmental tool for me. As a black woman, I have felt it necessary to work twice as hard in life to get as far as my counterparts.'She added: The automotive industry should have a larger presence at careers fairs and schools. We need to be sending ambassadors to connect with students who may otherwise not think of a career within the industry. Apart from anything else, can we continue to miss out on talented individuals who may not necessarily be aware of the reasons they should join us?'Sue Robinson, who heads the Retail Motor Industry Federation's National Franchised Dealers' Association representing the UK's main dealerships, said: We have come a long way. Training really has improved. No one can be more passionate than me about insuring that our female customers are treated well in showrooms.Women have huge buying power. Very often they are buying the car outright for themselves. But if any woman feels she is not being treated correctly then I want to know.'So it seems that the motor industry is perhaps moving in the right direction, but there are still plenty of improvements to be made.     Lisa BrankinManaging director Ford Britain and Ireland since September last year.

It represents 4,000 car dealerships across the UK, which employ 600,000 people.Moyosola FujamadeMedia-savvy and currently contract hire relationships manager for Surrey-based Kia UK, her recent report on women and diversity in the motor industry helped highlight the issue.   Ministers and police must do more to control the widespread and illegal use of electric two-wheelers, says the UK's largest independent road safety charity IAM RoadSmart.With nine fatalities and hundreds more injuries already this year, critics are concerned that the fast-moving e-scooters are an unregulated danger to road users.The problem is that confusion reigns' around the rules about e-scooters, says IAM.By law, only e-scooters rented from authorised providers as part of the Government's pilot trial are legal on UK roads.More than 50 areas are operating rental schemes including Birmingham, Bristol, Liverpool, and selected London boroughs.All others bought privately can be used legally only on private land. Riding an e-scooter outside such rental zones could land you with a £300 fine, six points on your licence and your e-scooter could even be impounded by the police,' says the charity.However, there is little evidence of widespread enforcement, despite some high-profile accidents and deaths. And sales of e-scooters are booming even though they cannot be used legally on the highway.A report by the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety (PACTS) says that this year up to mid-October there were more than 300 injury collisions in the UK, causing nine deaths and 79 serious injuries. That includes 24 head injuries. By contrast, in the previous two years there were three deaths.PACTS says there are 20,000 e-scooters legally on the road but 360,000 more were bought privately in 2020 alone and sales have continued in 2021'.© Daily Mail",Copyright 2021 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

678,WORKING TO MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE;ScottishPower Renewables is committed to green energy supplies,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Liverpool Echo,News,823,NEWS;Pg. 20,823,England & Wales,,,,,WORKING TO MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCEScottishPower Renewables is committed to green energy supplies,"As recently as a generation ago, coal-burning power stations were the UK's main source of electricity and their huge cooling towers were dominant features on our landscapes.In Liverpool, Lister Drive and Clarence Dock power stations were responsible for supplying the heat, light and electricity to keep appliances operating in homes and businesses across the city.But the power stations weren't just creating energy, they were also producing dangerous levels of toxic air pollution, making a potentially catastrophic contribution towards climate change.Now, as we recognise the urgent need to completely rethink and revolutionise how we get our energy, natural resources are being harnessed to produce cleaner greener alternatives like wind and solar power.Lindsay McQuade, chief executive of ScottishPower Renewables, a division of ScottishPower, and principal partner for COP26, said: ""When I tell my 11-year-old daughter that once our energy came from coal, which was so damaging to the environment, she asks me why didn't we use wind then. ""It's a smart question that many young people are asking.""McQuade started her own career with ScottishPower in 1999, when the firm operated coal-fired power stations across the UK. Over the two decades since, she's witnessed and played a part in the remarkable rise and scale of wind turbine One development in Britain.stations in years capacity coal water ""The answer to my daughter and her friends is that it has taken a transformation in the UK power industry and massive investment and innovation to make windfarms a key part of our energy mix.McQuade says this transformation is vital as nearly 70 per cent of the British public believe the climate emergency is now impacting on this country and there is a rising sense of urgency.She and her team are working to ensure our energy systems continue to tackle this emergency and that all of our electricity - with demand expected to double by 2050 - is net zero carbon by then.""The transformation of theUK to greener wind energy is a fantastic success story. But we have some way to go and we need to build more wind capacity, both onshore and offshore. We are an island that is using our natural resources, but we will need four times more green energy to power our country with green electricity,"" she says.Critics have claimed that fluctuations in the wind make it an unreliable source of power.of the technological fixes, such as improving battery storage for wind and solar power, are already available and the massive investment in wind is helping to reduce the cost to the consumers.""All the things that we need to do to 'electrify' our lifestyles are here. This will allow us to can move away with confidence from that familiar fossil fuel lifestyle, which we know is harmful.""For the country to reach its net zero carbon targets, it will require everyone to play their part. ""The good news is it can be done,"" assures McQuade.stations the two she's aHow times have changedOne of the most recognisable power stations in the region was at Fiddlers Ferry in Warrington. In operation for nearly 50 years before closing in March 2020, at full capacity it was burning 16,000 tonnes of coal and consuming 195 million litres of water from the River Mersey every day.The river is now central to Liverpool City Region's renewable energy plans and 2040 Zero Carbon target.and and make part of ourHow numbers add up for the power we useGadgets that use the most electricity tend to be those which heat and cool things, so your fridge, freezer, tumble dryer, oven, toaster and electric boiler are likely to add more towards your average electricity consumption and your bill than appliances like TVs or lamps. Even though a kettle uses less than a tenth of the energy of a dishwasher, if you make enough cups of tea or coffee in a day, it can overtake it.The average daily domestic use of electricity is between a low of 4.9kws, which costs a daily standard tariff of about £1.08, and a high of 11.7kws costing up to £2.24 per day. Factor in other everyday energy uses, maybe two hours on a laptop which adds another 1kw, or playing computer games for four hours accounting for another half a kilowatt, and it adds up.For 2020, Government's figures showed an average annual household consumption of 3,600 kWh/ year, although that obviously varies depending on the size of your house and how many people live in it. You can easily check your own domestic figure on your electricity bill.When all this usage is combined to include schools, hospitals, factories and other industry, it gives us a national figure for the country's energy consumption.

680,Worksop scientist calls on Bassetlaw District Council to declare a climate emergency,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Worksop Guardian,News,594,COUNCILENVIRONMENTHUMAN INTEREST,594,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Kirsty HamiltonKirsty.hamilton@jpress.co.uk,,,,Worksop scientist calls on Bassetlaw District Council to declare a climate emergency,"Dr Steffi Harangozo, who worked with the British Antarctic Survey for 17 years, has called on Bassetlaw District Council as one of the remaining 20 per cent of district councils that has not declared a climate emergency.The plea comes after UN leaders met in Glasgow for COP26, one for the biggest ever world meetings on how to tackle climate change.Bassetlaw District Council said it has made a commitment to achieving carbon neutrality within the local authority itself and has made achieving carbon neutrality ‘front and central” to its corporate plan, but bosses say it needs additional Government funding and resources to do more and have wider engagement with the public.Dr Harangozo, now a building energy assessor, said this response failed to answer why other councils are doing a “huge amount of work in their communities, working with businesses, and declaring climate emergencies, regardless of their finances and political persuasion.”Around 300 councils have declared a climate emergency, which acknowledges that each local authority needs to act on the causes and impacts of climate change.READ MORE:Residents protest against huge solar farm plan in BassetlawShe suggested the council use money collected from business rates from solar farms and set up a dedicated climate fund that support community and business carbon reduction initiatives.She suggested they could also encourage businesses and landlords to improve insulation and upgrade to LED lighting by giving discounts on business rates if they make their premises, and vehicles, more green.She said: “Bassetlaw District Council is the only organisation that can bring our district together to develop a shared climate emergency plan for everyone in the district.“We all deserve and have a right to expect that leadership from them.”In June, district councillor Helen Tamblyn-Saville proposed a motion calling for the council to declare a climate emergency, but it was voted down.She said: “The changing climate affects everyone and we all have a responsibility to try to make changes.“While we absolutely need the government to commit more to tackling the crisis.""Councils throughout the country, including Nottinghamshire councils, have declared climate emergencies to formally recognise the urgency of the situation.READ MORE: Worksop Poppy Appeal hailed a success after residents answer volunteering plea“That declaration would have shown a commitment to Bassetlaw residents that we take the changing climate seriously.“Of course actions are stronger than words, but a declaration helps to keep us accountable for our actions. The green agenda should always be considered when decision making.”Addressing the council opposing the climate emergency declaration, Bassetlaw MP Brendan Clarke-Smith said: “There’s nothing wrong with having a sensible debate on what we can all do to help protect our environment and how we can find ways to fund and deliver this, but turning a blind eye to climate change and denying there is a problem doesn’t help anybody.“Councils already receive significant funding for environmental schemes, so it’s not so much about throwing money at the issue as it is about changing the way we also go about our business and cutting out waste.“I am pleased to see that other local authorities are now taking a lead on this hugely important issue, because that’s where we need to start.""I know a lot of people were disappointed that we didn’t do the same thing in Bassetlaw.“Our local environment is precious and we should be doing everything we can to preserve it.”",Copyright 2021 JPIMedia Publishing Ltd All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|ENGLISH|CLIMATOLOGYCLIMATE CHANGEEARTH & ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCENEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWSREGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTSASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONSCARBON NEUTRAL INITIATIVESENVIRONMENTALISMTALKS & MEETINGSPROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONSCONSERVATION|CARBON NEUTRAL INITIATIVESPUBLISHING|GLASGOW, SCOTLAND|ANTARCTICA",
681,Xi's warm words welcome but will they stand the test of time?,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Australian,News,445,THENATION;Pg. 6,445,Australia,"Will Glasgow, COMMENT",,WIN CO LTD,WIN CO LTD,Xi's warm words welcome but will they stand the test of time?,"What to make of Xi Jinping's latest burst of televised diplomacy? China's supreme leader has some good advice.""Action speaks louder than words,"" he told the UN secretary-general in May. It's a useful framework when Beijing switches the rhetorical dial from might-is-right to ""building a shared future"", as Xi did in his video address to the APEC CEO Summit on Thursday.There was plenty for an Australian audience to roll its eyes at. ""China will continue to practice true multilateralism, uphold the WTO-centred multilateral trading system â€¦ and promote the building of an open world economy,"" Xi said.Australia has had an almost two-year long masterclass in how hollow those words are. Exports previously worth more than $20bn a year remain black-listed by Beijing for political reasons.It is why there is such wariness in Canberra about Xi's bid to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans--Pacific Partnership, which China's leader spruiked again in his speech.While Xi might not be very convincing to an Australian audience, we should pay attention to his tone.Aside from an indirect swipe at the Quad and AUKUS - ""small circles"", in his phrase - China's leader was determined to present his sunniest face.His delivery was accompanied by some actions we should also be watching very closely.China's joint agreement with the US at the end of the COP26 summit in Glasgow gave the passage in Xi's speech on climate change a jolt of credibility.Of course, what China does is what matters, but the agreement indicates the world's most important bilateral relationship is not -entirely dysfunctional.Next week comes another significant action. Xi is set to meet US President Joe Biden for their long-heralded virtual summit.Of course, it won't end the fierce competition between the two great powers. It might, however, slightly lower the temperature of their systemic competition.To that end, Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan - days before his Lowy Institute address on Thursday - assured Beijing ""a fundamental trans-form-ation of the Chinese system"" was not a US policy goal.The China Daily, a party mouthpiece, welcomed those -remarks, saying they gave ""significant assurance to Beijing, which has long suspected Washington has a hidden agenda to seek -regime change in China"".Xi also wrote a warm letter to Biden, which was widely republished in China's state media on Thursday. In his note, he said China-US ties were ""at a critical historical juncture"" and offered his counterpart ""mutual respect, peaceful co-existence and win-win co-operation"". Lovely words, just like much of his APEC speech.

691,You'd be a very brave person to tell the Queen she couldn't attend';REMEMBRANCE SUNDAY CHARLES CONFIRMS HER MAJESTY IS 'ALL RIGHT',"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,The Express,News,989,"NEWS;Pg. 6,7",989,United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,Richard Palmer,,,,You'd be a very brave person to tell the Queen she couldn't attend'REMEMBRANCE SUNDAY CHARLES CONFIRMS HER MAJESTY IS 'ALL RIGHT',"THE Queen will defy doctors' advice to rest as she honours the nation's war dead at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday.Buckingham Palace confirmed last night that Her Majesty, 95, who has had hospital tests for an unspecified ailment, will be at the Whitehall service.The announcement came after a jovial Prince Charles reassured a well-wisher yesterday that his mother was ""all right"".Her decision to attend Sunday's service is a sign of the importance the monarch places on commemorating the sacrifice of her wartime generation and those in other conflicts.A royal insider said: ""It is inked in her diary.You'd be a very brave person to tell her she couldn't attend it.""But, still ""mindful of her doctors'recent advice"", the Palace said the Queen would not be at the General Synod of the Church of England on Tuesday.Royal officials believe it is the first time the Church's supreme governor has missed her five-yearly General Synod visit in 51 years.Buckingham Palace said Prince Edward would be attending instead ""as planned"".It is understood the Queen has also cleared her diary of engagements for the next few weeks.In her role as head of State, perhaps only the task of opening Parliament is seen as more important than Remembrance Sunday.The Queen, who trained as a mechanic and driver during the Second World War, vowed on her 21st birthday that ""my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service"".Buckingham Palace said last night she will view Sunday's event - Charles' 73rd birthday - from the balcony of the Foreign,Commonwealth and Development Office building in central London.Her Majesty has not joined Royal Family members on parade in front of the Cenotaph since 2017.She has opted instead to watch from above and let Charles lay a wreath on her behalf.Prince William will later take the salute at the march-past of veteran organisations on Horse Guards Parade.The Palace had already said the Queen would not attend tomorrow's annual Festival of Remembrance at London's Royal Albert Hall.SpeculationLast month she used a walking stick in public for the first time in 17 years - she last had one in 2004 following a knee op.And royal watchers have speculated that getting up and down steps at both the Royal Albert Hall and Church House in Westminster might be reasons for staying away.She can, however, get a lift to the balcony room at the ForeignOffice. Doctors clearly still have concerns but yesterday Charles reassured a man about her health.The well-wisher in Brixton, south London, asked: ""How is your mother?"" Patting him on the arm, Charles replied: ""She's all right, thank you.""The Prince's comment came as he was greeted by a crowd after leaving NatWest bank, where he visited young entrepreneurs supported by his Prince's Trust.His mother has been ordered to rest since October 20, when she spent a night in the private King EdwardVII's Hospital in London.She then cancelled several big engagements, including a two-day visit to Northern Ireland to celebrate the country's centenary, and the COP26 summit in Glasgow.However, she was well enough to fly by helicopter to spend a long weekend at Wood Farm on her Sandringham estate in Norfolk.Her Majesty returned to Windsor Castle on Tuesday after touring the estate to see horses in the stud.While there, she also inspected how Charles has overseen the 20,000-acre estate's conversion to organic farming.Meanwhile, Majesty magazine managing editor Joe Little said of last night's Palace announcement: ""I think it's an encouraging sign that Her Majesty is on pretty good form.""I was slightly sceptical that she would go to the Cenotaph until she went to Sandringham.""The Queen has been sticking to light duties, including going through her daily State papers and taking part in virtual audiences. On Wednesday, she presided over a video-linked Privy Council meeting.Meanwhile, a cheerful Charles had his mind read by magician Chris Wall during his meeting yesterday with the Prince's Trust entrepreneurs.Chris, 29, who performs as Chris Reads Minds, asked him to think of a name, number and colour. Looking nervous at first, Charles chose blue and 12, but struggled to think of a name.The Prince asked: ""Any name? Of any person? Oh dear..."" He then laughed and, opting for his eldest grandchild, declared: ""George!""Chris pulled out a card and wrote down the details Charles had given him. He then produced one of his own business cards, hidden in a sealed envelope, on which the same answers had been written.BlushedAs Charles looked on in admiration, he said: ""You can keep that as a memento of our time together.""The Prince replied: ""Very impressive, it really is. Well done. And you have the gift of the gab too. You've been a huge success.""Chris, from Brockley, south London, said a Prince's Trust Enterprise scheme helped him to start his own business.He said: ""It taught me both fundamental and advance business skills. Quite honestly, I wouldn't be here without it. It was fantastic just to be able to thank him."" Local councillor Jacqui Dyer told Charles that not only had he given her an honour for services to mental health but they shared the same birthday November 14. He replied: ""Us Scorpios need to stick together.""Charles also enjoyed an enlightening encounter with Keshia East, who told him the trust's enterprise scheme had given her invaluable help.She has set up NoKnotCo, an award-winning range of environmentally-friendly hair styling tools, with an emphasis on Afro and curly hair, made from plant cellulose.And, admiring his locks, she told Charles, ""I can see some waves in your hair"", to which the Prince blushed and said: ""Oh yes I know.""Keshia, 29, said she started her firm when she could not find a suitable product for her own hair.She then showed the Royal a brush that helps stimulate the scalp and promote growth. Stroking his own hair, Charles asked her ruefully: ""Does it work?OPINION: PAGE 12",Copyright 2021 Express Newspapers All Rights Reserved,,"Newspaper|DXP|ENGLISH|National Edition|BRITISH ROYALTYROYALTY, NOBILITY & GENTRYHEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENTMONARCHIESFAMILYPROTESTANTS & PROTESTANTISMRELIGIONTRENDS & EVENTSWORLD WAR IICHRISTIANS & CHRISTIANITYPARADES & MARCHESFESTIVALSASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS|BRITISH ROYALTYROYALTY, NOBILITY & GENTRYFESTIVALS|PRINCE CHARLESPRINCE WILLIAM|LONDON, ENGLANDWESTMINSTER, ENGLAND|ENGLAND",
692,YOUR VIEW;Patrick Monahan has been thinking 'green' lately...,"November 12, 2021 Friday",International,Evening Gazette,News,281,NEWS;Pg. 36,281,England & Wales,,,,,YOUR VIEWPatrick Monahan has been thinking 'green' lately...,"THE last couple of weeks the news and TV has been dominated by the COP26 Earth summit.I don't know about you, but it made me feel more conscious about the planet and about being 'more ethical, greener and reducing my carbon footprint'.I'll be honest with you - I don't actually know what being more ethical or greener means and I'm still not totally sure what our carbon footprint is and how we actually measure it!If someone invents a thick pair of environmentally friendly socks, can that reduce our carbon footprint? I'm not sure but I think someone on Dragon's Den will find out.It spurred me into action. I thought, I'll write everything down in a diary of all my travelling, carbon emissions and everyday activities to see if I can become greener.Then I panicked, because buying a diary to write everything down in, is so unethical.The diary is made of paper and cardboard, which would involve cutting down more trees to produce these diaries, which in turn would mean that the band Coldplay would have to perform more concerts to replant more trees.As they pledged last week that for every single ticket they sell on tour, they will replant a tree.If they play a concert in Middlesbrough and sell 50,000 tickets, that means they'll have to plant 50,000 trees on Teesside.Linthorpe Road will become a forest, and eventually everyone will be living in tree houses instead of town houses.Which might actually be greener for the planet, homes will be made out of sustainable materials (trees) and they will be safe from rising sea levels and flooding.And instead of using paper diaries and books, we can just write straight on to the side of the trees and not get arrested for graffiti.",Copyright 2021 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved,,Newspaper|EGM|ENGLISH|National Edition|ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINTCORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITYDIARY KEEPING & JOURNALINGEMISSIONSENVIRONMENTALISMSUSTAINABILITYSUSTAINABLE FORESTRYARRESTSCLIMATE CHANGEGREENHOUSE GASESENVIRONMENT & NATURAL RESOURCESNEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS|EMISSIONSSUSTAINABLE FORESTRY,
